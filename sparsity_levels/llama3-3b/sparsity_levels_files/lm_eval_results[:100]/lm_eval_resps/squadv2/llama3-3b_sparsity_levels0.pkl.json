The supplementary meat and materials from hunting included protein, bone for implements, sinew for cordage, fur, feathers, rawhide and leather used in clothing. Man's earliest hunting weapons would have included rocks, spears, the atlatl, and bows and arrows. Hunting is still vital in marginal climates, especially those unsuited for pastoral uses or agriculture.[citation needed] For example, Inuit people in the Arctic trap and hunt animals for clothing and use the skins of sea mammals to make kayaks, clothing, and footwear.\n\nQuestion: What would the Inuit people use to decorate their clothing?\n\nAnswer:  unanswerable\n\nTitle: Neptune\n\nBackground: In 2007, it was discovered that the upper troposphere of Neptune's south pole was about 10 K warmer than the rest of its atmosphere, which averages approximately 73 K (\u2212200 \u00b0C). The temperature differential is enough to let methane, which elsewhere is frozen in the troposphere, escape into the stratosphere near the pole. The relative \"hot spot\" is due to Neptune's axial tilt, which has exposed the south pole to the Sun for the last quarter of Neptune's year, or roughly 40 Earth years. As Neptune slowly moves towards the opposite side of the Sun, the south pole will be darkened and the north pole illuminated, causing the methane release to shift to the north pole.\n\nQuestion:  What is the average temperature of Neptune's north pole?\n\nAnswer:  unanswerable\n\nTitle: The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Twilight_Princess\n\nBackground: The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess (Japanese: \u30bc\u30eb\u30c0\u306e\u4f1d\u8aac \u30c8\u30ef\u30a4\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bb\u30b9, Hepburn: Zeruda no Densetsu: Towairaito Purinsesu?) is an action-adventure game developed and published by Nintendo for the GameCube and Wii home video game consoles. It is the thirteenth installment in the The Legend of Zelda series. Originally planned for release on the GameCube in November 2005, Twilight Princess was delayed by Nintendo to allow its developers to refine the game, add more content, and port it to the Wii. The Wii version was released alongside the console in North America in November 2006, and in Japan, Europe, and Australia the following month. The GameCube version was released worldwide in December 2006.[b]\n\nQuestion: What consoles can be used to play Australia Twilight?\n\nAnswer:  unanswerable\n\nTitle: Capital_punishment_in_the_United_States\n\nBackground: All of the executions which have taken place since the 1936 hanging of Bethea in Owensboro have been conducted within a wall or enclosure. For example, Fred Adams was legally hanged in Kennett, Missouri, on April 2, 1937, within a 10-foot (3 m) wooden stockade. Roscoe \"Red\" Jackson was hanged within a stockade in Galena, Missouri, on May 26, 1937. Two Kentucky hangings were conducted after Galena in which numerous persons were present within a wooden stockade, that of John \"Peter\" Montjoy in Covington, Kentucky on December 17, 1937, and that of Harold Van Venison in Covington on June 3, 1938. An estimated 400 witnesses were present for the hanging of Lee Simpson in Ryegate, Montana, on December 30, 1939. The execution of Timothy McVeigh on June 11, 2001 was witnessed by some 300 people, some by closed-circuit television.\n\nQuestion:  What was Roscoe Jackson's birthdate?\n\nAnswer:  unanswerable\n\nTitle: European_Central_Bank\n\nBackground: The independence of the ECB is instrumental in maintaining price stability. Not only must the bank not seek influence, but EU institutions and national governments are bound by the treaties to respect the ECB's independence. To offer some accountability, the ECB is bound to publish reports on its activities and has to address its annual report to the European Parliament, the European Commission, the Council of the European Union and the European Council. The European Parliament also gets to question and then issue its opinion on candidates to the executive board.\n\nQuestion: Why do EU institutions and national governments have to respect the independence of the ECB?\n\nAnswer:  bound by the treaties\n\nTitle: Rule_of_law\n\nBackground: There has recently been an effort to reevaluate the influence of the Bible on Western constitutional law. In the Old Testament, there was some language in Deuteronomy imposing restrictions on the Jewish king, regarding such things as how many wives he could have, and how many horses he could own for his personal use. According to Professor Bernard M.

They were descended from Norse (\"Norman\" comes from \"Norseman\") raiders and pirates from Denmark, Iceland and Norway who, under their leader Rollo, agreed to swear fealty to King Charles III of West Francia. Through generations of assimilation and mixing with the native Frankish and Roman-Gaulish populations, their descendants would gradually merge with the Carolingian-based cultures of West Francia.

The supplementary meat and materials from hunting included protein, bone for implements, sinew for cordage, fur, feathers, rawhide and leather used in clothing. Man's earliest hunting weapons would have included rocks, spears, the atlatl, and bows and arrows. Hunting is still vital in marginal climates, especially those unsuited for pastoral uses or agriculture.[citation needed] For example, Inuit people in the Arctic trap and hunt animals for clothing and use the skins of sea mammals to make kayaks, clothing, and footwear.\n\nQuestion: What would the Inuit people use to decorate their clothing?\n\nAnswer:  unanswerable\n\nTitle: Neptune\n\nBackground: In 2007, it was discovered that the upper troposphere of Neptune's south pole was about 10 K warmer than the rest of its atmosphere, which averages approximately 73 K (\u2212200 \u00b0C). The temperature differential is enough to let methane, which elsewhere is frozen in the troposphere, escape into the stratosphere near the pole. The relative \"hot spot\" is due to Neptune's axial tilt, which has exposed the south pole to the Sun for the last quarter of Neptune's year, or roughly 40 Earth years. As Neptune slowly moves towards the opposite side of the Sun, the south pole will be darkened and the north pole illuminated, causing the methane release to shift to the north pole.\n\nQuestion:  What is the average temperature of Neptune's north pole?\n\nAnswer:  unanswerable\n\nTitle: The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Twilight_Princess\n\nBackground: The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess (Japanese: \u30bc\u30eb\u30c0\u306e\u4f1d\u8aac \u30c8\u30ef\u30a4\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bb\u30b9, Hepburn: Zeruda no Densetsu: Towairaito Purinsesu?) is an action-adventure game developed and published by Nintendo for the GameCube and Wii home video game consoles. It is the thirteenth installment in the The Legend of Zelda series. Originally planned for release on the GameCube in November 2005, Twilight Princess was delayed by Nintendo to allow its developers to refine the game, add more content, and port it to the Wii. The Wii version was released alongside the console in North America in November 2006, and in Japan, Europe, and Australia the following month. The GameCube version was released worldwide in December 2006.[b]\n\nQuestion: What consoles can be used to play Australia Twilight?\n\nAnswer:  unanswerable\n\nTitle: Capital_punishment_in_the_United_States\n\nBackground: All of the executions which have taken place since the 1936 hanging of Bethea in Owensboro have been conducted within a wall or enclosure. For example, Fred Adams was legally hanged in Kennett, Missouri, on April 2, 1937, within a 10-foot (3 m) wooden stockade. Roscoe \"Red\" Jackson was hanged within a stockade in Galena, Missouri, on May 26, 1937. Two Kentucky hangings were conducted after Galena in which numerous persons were present within a wooden stockade, that of John \"Peter\" Montjoy in Covington, Kentucky on December 17, 1937, and that of Harold Van Venison in Covington on June 3, 1938. An estimated 400 witnesses were present for the hanging of Lee Simpson in Ryegate, Montana, on December 30, 1939. The execution of Timothy McVeigh on June 11, 2001 was witnessed by some 300 people, some by closed-circuit television.\n\nQuestion:  What was Roscoe Jackson's birthdate?\n\nAnswer:  unanswerable\n\nTitle: European_Central_Bank\n\nBackground: The independence of the ECB is instrumental in maintaining price stability. Not only must the bank not seek influence, but EU institutions and national governments are bound by the treaties to respect the ECB's independence. To offer some accountability, the ECB is bound to publish reports on its activities and has to address its annual report to the European Parliament, the European Commission, the Council of the European Union and the European Council. The European Parliament also gets to question and then issue its opinion on candidates to the executive board.\n\nQuestion: Why do EU institutions and national governments have to respect the independence of the ECB?\n\nAnswer:  bound by the treaties\n\nTitle: Rule_of_law\n\nBackground: There has recently been an effort to reevaluate the influence of the Bible on Western constitutional law. In the Old Testament, there was some language in Deuteronomy imposing restrictions on the Jewish king, regarding such things as how many wives he could have, and how many horses he could own for his personal use. According to Professor Bernard M. Levinson, \"This legislation was so utopian in its own time that it seems never to have been implemented....\" The Deuteronomic social vision may have influenced opponents of the divine right of kings, including Bishop John Ponet in sixteenth-century England.\n\nQuestion: According to the restrictions placed on Jewish kings in Deuteronomy, ownership over what was regulated?\n\nAnswer:  horses\n\nTitle: Normans\n\nBackground: The Normans (Norman: Nourmands; French: Normands; Latin: Normanni) were the people who in the 10th and 11th centuries gave their name to Normandy, a region in France.

Because there is no income tax, the island's legislative assembly raises money through an import duty, fuel levy, medicare levy, GST of 12% and local/international phone calls. In a move that apparently surprised many islanders the Chief Minister of Norfolk Island, David Buffett, announced on 6 November 2010 that the island would voluntarily surrender its tax free status in return for a financial bailout from the federal government to cover significant debts. The introduction of income taxation will now come into effect on July 1, 2016, with a variation of opinion on the island about these changes but with many understanding that for the island's governance to continue there is a need to pay into the commonwealth revenue pool so that the island can have assistance in supporting its delivery of State government responsibilities such as health, education, medicare, and infrastructure.

The first German raid on London, on 7 September 1940, killed about one thousand civilians, mostly in the East End. On 13 September, the King and Queen narrowly avoided death when two German bombs exploded in a courtyard at Buckingham Palace while they were there. In defiance, the Queen famously declared: \"I am glad we have been bombed. It makes me feel we can look the East End in the face\". The royal family were portrayed as sharing the same dangers and deprivations as the rest of the country.

Bird hunting is primarily a recreational activity except in extremely undeveloped areas. The most important birds hunted in North and South America are waterfowl; other widely hunted birds include pheasants, wild turkeys, quail, doves, partridge, grouse, snipe, and woodcock. Muttonbirding is also popular in Australia and New Zealand.

Time is used to define other quantities\u2014such as velocity\u2014so defining time in terms of such quantities would result in circularity of definition. An operational definition of time, wherein one says that observing a certain number of repetitions of one or another standard cyclical event (such as the passage of a free-swinging pendulum) constitutes one standard unit such as the second, is highly useful in the conduct of both advanced experiments and everyday affairs of life. The operational definition leaves aside the question whether there is something called time, apart from the counting activity just mentioned, that flows and that can be measured. Investigations of a single continuum called spacetime bring questions about space into questions about time, questions that have their roots in the works of early students of natural philosophy.\n\nQuestion: Time is one of the fundamental physical quantities in which two systems?\n\nAnswer:  the International System of Units and International System of Quantities\n\nTitle: Melbourne\n\nBackground: The Story of the Kelly Gang, the world's first feature film, was shot in Melbourne in 1906. Melbourne filmmakers continued to produce bushranger films until they were banned by Victorian politicians in 1912 for the perceived promotion of crime, thus contributing to the decline of one of the silent film era's most productive industries. A notable film shot and set in Melbourne during Australia's cinematic lull is On the Beach (1959). The 1970s saw the rise of the Australian New Wave and its Ozploitation offshoot, instigated by Melbourne-based productions Stork and Alvin Purple. Picnic at Hanging Rock and Mad Max, both shot in and around Melbourne, achieved worldwide acclaim. 2004 saw the construction of Melbourne's largest film and television studio complex, Docklands Studios Melbourne, which has hosted many domestic productions, as well as international features. Melbourne is also home to the headquarters of Village Roadshow Pictures, Australia's largest film production company. Famous modern day actors from Melbourne include Cate Blanchett, Rachel Griffiths, Guy Pearce, Geoffrey Rush and Eric Bana.\n\nQuestion: What was the world's first feature film?\n\nAnswer:  The Story of the Kelly Gang\n\nTitle: Pesticide\n\nBackground: The following sulfonylureas have been commercialized for weed control: amidosulfuron, azimsulfuron, bensulfuron-methyl, chlorimuron-ethyl, ethoxysulfuron, flazasulfuron, flupyrsulfuron-methyl-sodium, halosulfuron-methyl, imazosulfuron, nicosulfuron, oxasulfuron, primisulfuron-methyl, pyrazosulfuron-ethyl, rimsulfuron, sulfometuron-methyl Sulfosulfuron, terbacil, bispyribac-sodium, cyclosulfamuron, and pyrithiobac-sodium. Nicosulfuron, triflusulfuron methyl, and chlorsulfuron are broad-spectrum herbicides that kill plants by inhibiting the enzyme acetolactate synthase. In the 1960s, more than 1 kg/ha (0.89 lb/acre) crop protection chemical was typically applied, while sulfonylureates allow as little as 1% as much material to achieve the same effect.\n\nQuestion: What is acetolactate synthase classified as when used on plants?\n\nAnswer:  unanswerable\n\nTitle: Premier_League\n\nBackground: The Football Association Premier League Ltd (FAPL) is operated as a corporation and is owned by the 20 member clubs. Each club is a shareholder, with one vote each on issues such as rule changes and contracts. The clubs elect a chairman, chief executive, and board of directors to oversee the daily operations of the league. The current chairman is Sir Dave Richards, who was appointed in April 1999, and the chief executive is Richard Scudamore, appointed in November 1999. The former chairman and chief executive, John Quinton and Peter Leaver, were forced to resign in March 1999 after awarding consultancy contracts to former Sky executives Sam Chisholm and David Chance. The Football Association is not directly involved in the day-to-day operations of the Premier League, but has veto power as a special shareholder during the election of the chairman and chief executive and when new rules are adopted by the league.\n\nQuestion: Does the Football Association say about the management of the Premier League?\n\nAnswer:  has veto power as a special shareholder during the election of the chairman and chief executive and when new rules are adopted by the league.\n\nTitle: Normans\n\nBackground: The Normans (Norman: Nourmands; French: Normands; Latin: Normanni) were the people who in the 10th and 11th centuries gave their name to Normandy, a region in France.

Another provision established the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission as the agency charged with ending discrimination in the nation's workplace.:74\n\nQuestion: What was the purpose of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act?\n\nAnswer:  to end discrimination in all firms with 25 or more employees\n\nTitle: Prime_minister\n\nBackground: The post of prime minister may be encountered both in constitutional monarchies (such as Belgium, Denmark, Japan, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Malaysia, Morocco, Spain, Sweden, Thailand, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom), and in parliamentary republics in which the head of state is an elected official (such as Finland ,the Czech Republic, France, Greece, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Pakistan, Portugal, Montenegro, Croatia, Bulgaria, Romania, Serbia and Turkey). See also \"First Minister\", \"Premier\", \"Chief Minister\", \"Chancellor\", \"Taoiseach\", \"Statsminister\" and \"Secretary of State\": alternative titles usually equivalent in meaning to, or translated as, \"prime minister\".\n\nQuestion: What other country besides Greece is a constitutional monarch?\n\nAnswer:  unanswerable\n\nTitle: Time\n\nBackground: Time is one of the seven fundamental physical quantities in both the International System of Units and International System of Quantities. Time is used to define other quantities\u2014such as velocity\u2014so defining time in terms of such quantities would result in circularity of definition. An operational definition of time, wherein one says that observing a certain number of repetitions of one or another standard cyclical event (such as the passage of a free-swinging pendulum) constitutes one standard unit such as the second, is highly useful in the conduct of both advanced experiments and everyday affairs of life. The operational definition leaves aside the question whether there is something called time, apart from the counting activity just mentioned, that flows and that can be measured. Investigations of a single continuum called spacetime bring questions about space into questions about time, questions that have their roots in the works of early students of natural philosophy.\n\nQuestion: Time is one of the fundamental physical quantities in which two systems?\n\nAnswer:  the International System of Units and International System of Quantities\n\nTitle: Melbourne\n\nBackground: The Story of the Kelly Gang, the world's first feature film, was shot in Melbourne in 1906. Melbourne filmmakers continued to produce bushranger films until they were banned by Victorian politicians in 1912 for the perceived promotion of crime, thus contributing to the decline of one of the silent film era's most productive industries. A notable film shot and set in Melbourne during Australia's cinematic lull is On the Beach (1959). The 1970s saw the rise of the Australian New Wave and its Ozploitation offshoot, instigated by Melbourne-based productions Stork and Alvin Purple. Picnic at Hanging Rock and Mad Max, both shot in and around Melbourne, achieved worldwide acclaim. 2004 saw the construction of Melbourne's largest film and television studio complex, Docklands Studios Melbourne, which has hosted many domestic productions, as well as international features. Melbourne is also home to the headquarters of Village Roadshow Pictures, Australia's largest film production company. Famous modern day actors from Melbourne include Cate Blanchett, Rachel Griffiths, Guy Pearce, Geoffrey Rush and Eric Bana.\n\nQuestion: What was the world's first feature film?\n\nAnswer:  The Story of the Kelly Gang\n\nTitle: Pesticide\n\nBackground: The following sulfonylureas have been commercialized for weed control: amidosulfuron, azimsulfuron, bensulfuron-methyl, chlorimuron-ethyl, ethoxysulfuron, flazasulfuron, flupyrsulfuron-methyl-sodium, halosulfuron-methyl, imazosulfuron, nicosulfuron, oxasulfuron, primisulfuron-methyl, pyrazosulfuron-ethyl, rimsulfuron, sulfometuron-methyl Sulfosulfuron, terbacil, bispyribac-sodium, cyclosulfamuron, and pyrithiobac-sodium. Nicosulfuron, triflusulfuron methyl, and chlorsulfuron are broad-spectrum herbicides that kill plants by inhibiting the enzyme acetolactate synthase. In the 1960s, more than 1 kg/ha (0.89 lb/acre) crop protection chemical was typically applied, while sulfonylureates allow as little as 1% as much material to achieve the same effect.\n\nQuestion: What is acetolactate synthase classified as when used on plants?\n\nAnswer:  unanswerable\n\nTitle: Premier_League\n\nBackground: The Football Association Premier League Ltd (FAPL) is operated as a corporation and is owned by the 20 member clubs. Each club is a shareholder, with one vote each on issues such as rule changes and contracts. The clubs elect a chairman, chief executive, and board of directors to oversee the daily operations of the league. The current chairman is Sir Dave Richards, who was appointed in April 1999, and the chief executive is Richard Scudamore, appointed in November 1999. The former chairman and chief executive, John Quinton and Peter Leaver, were forced to resign in March 1999 after awarding consultancy contracts to former Sky executives Sam Chisholm and David Chance. The Football Association is not directly involved in the day-to-day operations of the Premier League, but has veto power as a special shareholder during the election of the chairman and chief executive and when new rules are adopted by the league.\n\nQuestion: Does the Football Association say about the management of the Premier League?\n\nAnswer:  has veto power as a special shareholder during the election of the chairman and chief executive and when new rules are adopted by the league.\n\nTitle: Normans\n\nBackground: The Normans (Norman: Nourmands; French: Normands; Latin: Normanni) were the people who in the 10th and 11th centuries gave their name to Normandy, a region in France. They were descended from Norse (\"Norman\" comes from \"Norseman\") raiders and pirates from Denmark, Iceland and Norway who, under their leader Rollo, agreed to swear fealty to King Charles III of West Francia. Through generations of assimilation and mixing with the native Frankish and Roman-Gaulish populations, their descendants would gradually merge with the Carolingian-based cultures of West Francia. The distinct cultural and ethnic identity of the Normans emerged initially in the first half of the 10th century, and it continued to evolve over the succeeding centuries.\n\nQuestion: When did the Frankish identity emerge?\n\nAnswer:", " unanswerable"]], "resps": [["  unanswerable"], [[-7.4921875, false]]], "filtered_resps": ["  unanswerable", [-7.4921875, false]], "filter": "none", "metrics": ["exact", "f1", "HasAns_exact", "HasAns_f1", "NoAns_exact", "NoAns_f1", "best_exact", "best_f1"], "doc_hash": "bd26c915a393dae17eca6cebb8115dbf1d72b43c6ea6ab7c52e720c6c09d6af1", "prompt_hash": "77cc3457ea1d4797dd53fede0b5ebd2ad076f143de3963ed66a29c67caaa51ca", "target_hash": "a77a7434534bff301720676f050b879d5dcc80c28a20c845042f472eb1790710", "exact": [{"id": "5ad39d53604f3c001a3fe8d4", "prediction_text": "  unanswerable", "no_answer_probability": 0.0005574222646262701}, {"id": "5ad39d53604f3c001a3fe8d4", "answers": {"text": [], "answer_start": []}}], "f1": [{"id": "5ad39d53604f3c001a3fe8d4", "prediction_text": "  unanswerable", "no_answer_probability": 0.0005574222646262701}, {"id": "5ad39d53604f3c001a3fe8d4", "answers": {"text": [], "answer_start": []}}], "HasAns_exact": [{"id": "5ad39d53604f3c001a3fe8d4", "prediction_text": "  unanswerable", "no_answer_probability": 0.0005574222646262701}, {"id": "5ad39d53604f3c001a3fe8d4", "answers": {"text": [], "answer_start": []}}], "HasAns_f1": [{"id": "5ad39d53604f3c001a3fe8d4", "prediction_text": "  unanswerable", "no_answer_probability": 0.0005574222646262701}, {"id": "5ad39d53604f3c001a3fe8d4", "answers": {"text": [], "answer_start": []}}], "NoAns_exact": [{"id": "5ad39d53604f3c001a3fe8d4", "prediction_text": "  unanswerable", "no_answer_probability": 0.0005574222646262701}, {"id": "5ad39d53604f3c001a3fe8d4", "answers": {"text": [], "answer_start": []}}], "NoAns_f1": [{"id": "5ad39d53604f3c001a3fe8d4", "prediction_text": "  unanswerable", "no_answer_probability": 0.0005574222646262701}, {"id": "5ad39d53604f3c001a3fe8d4", "answers": {"text": [], "answer_start": []}}], "best_exact": [{"id": "5ad39d53604f3c001a3fe8d4", "prediction_text": "  unanswerable", "no_answer_probability": 0.0005574222646262701}, {"id": "5ad39d53604f3c001a3fe8d4", "answers": {"text": [], "answer_start": []}}], "best_f1": [{"id": "5ad39d53604f3c001a3fe8d4", "prediction_text": "  unanswerable", "no_answer_probability": 0.0005574222646262701}, {"id": "5ad39d53604f3c001a3fe8d4", "answers": {"text": [], "answer_start": []}}]}, {"doc_id": 9, "doc": {"id": "56dddf4066d3e219004dad5f", "title": "Normans", "context": "The Norman dynasty had a major political, cultural and military impact on medieval Europe and even the Near East.

He argued that the fact of existence can not be inferred from or accounted for by the essence of existing things, and that form and matter by themselves cannot interact and originate the movement of the universe or the progressive actualization of existing things. Existence must, therefore, be due to an agent-cause that necessitates, imparts, gives, or adds existence to an essence.

Because the discs were read optically instead of magnetically, no physical contact needs to be made between the player and the disc, except for the player's clamp that holds the disc at its center as it is spun and read. As a result, playback would not wear the information-bearing part of the discs, and properly manufactured LDs would theoretically last beyond one's lifetime.

They travel by train to the nearest station, but are once again confronted by Hinx; they engage in a fight throughout the train in which Mr Hinx is eventually thrown off the train by Bond with Swann's assistance. After arriving at the station, Bond and Swann are escorted to Oberhauser's base. There, he reveals that Spectre has been staging terrorist attacks around the world, creating a need for the Nine Eyes programme. In return Spectre will be given unlimited access to intelligence gathered by Nine Eyes. Bond is tortured as Oberhauser discusses their shared history: after the younger Bond was orphaned, Oberhauser's father, Hannes, became his temporary guardian.

The neighbouring island of Mykonos was ranked as the 5th best island Europe. Thessaloniki was the European Youth Capital in 2014.\n\nQuestion: What have a number of tourism-related organizations placed Greek destinations at the top of?\n\nAnswer:  their lists\n\nTitle: Pope_Paul_VI\n\nBackground: Upon his election to the papacy, Montini took the pontifical name Paul VI (the first to take the name \"Paul\" since 1605) to indicate a renewed worldwide mission to spread the message of Christ, following the example of Apostle St. Paul.[citation needed] He re-convened the Second Vatican Council, which was automatically closed with the death of John XXIII, and gave it priority and direction. After the council had concluded its work, Paul VI took charge of the interpretation and implementation of its mandates, often walking a thin line between the conflicting expectations of various groups within Catholicism. The magnitude and depth of the reforms affecting all fields of Church life during his pontificate exceeded similar reform policies of his predecessors and successors. Paul VI was a Marian devotee, speaking repeatedly to Marian congresses and mariological meetings, visiting Marian shrines and issuing three Marian encyclicals. Following his famous predecessor Saint Ambrose of Milan, he named Mary as the Mother of the Church during the Second Vatican Council. Paul VI sought dialogue with the world, with other Christians, other religions, and atheists, excluding nobody. He saw himself as a humble servant for a suffering humanity and demanded significant changes of the rich in North America and Europe in favour of the poor in the Third World. His positions on birth control, promulgated most famously in the 1968 encyclical Humanae vitae, and other political issues, were often controversial, especially in Western Europe and North America.\n\nQuestion: What type of devotee was Pope Paul VI?\n\nAnswer:  Marian\n\nTitle: Canadian_Armed_Forces\n\nBackground: Battles which are particularly notable to the Canadian military include the Battle of Vimy Ridge, the Dieppe Raid, the Battle of Ortona, the Battle of Passchendaele, the Normandy Landings, the Battle for Caen, the Battle of the Scheldt, the Battle of Britain, the Battle of the Atlantic, the strategic bombing of German cities, and more recently the Battle of Medak Pocket, in Croatia.\n\nQuestion:  What country was the latest French Military effort?\n\nAnswer:  unanswerable\n\nTitle: Normans\n\nBackground: The Norman dynasty had a major political, cultural and military impact on medieval Europe and even the Near East. The Normans were famed for their martial spirit and eventually for their Christian piety, becoming exponents of the Catholic orthodoxy into which they assimilated. They adopted the Gallo-Romance language of the Frankish land they settled, their dialect becoming known as Norman, Normaund or Norman French, an important literary language. The Duchy of Normandy, which they formed by treaty with the French crown, was a great fief of medieval France, and under Richard I of Normandy was forged into a cohesive and formidable principality in feudal tenure. The Normans are noted both for their culture, such as their unique Romanesque architecture and musical traditions, and for their significant military accomplishments and innovations. Norman adventurers founded the Kingdom of Sicily under Roger II after conquering southern Italy on the Saracens and Byzantines, and an expedition on behalf of their duke, William the Conqueror, led to the Norman conquest of England at the Battle of Hastings in 1066. Norman cultural and military influence spread from these new European centres to the Crusader states of the Near East, where their prince Bohemond I founded the Principality of Antioch in the Levant, to Scotland and Wales in Great Britain, to Ireland, and to the coasts of north Africa and the Canary Islands.\n\nQuestion: Who ruled the duchy of Normandy\n\nAnswer:", {"until": ["\n"]}], ["Title: Avicenna\n\nBackground: Following al-Farabi's lead, Avicenna initiated a full-fledged inquiry into the question of being, in which he distinguished between essence (Mahiat) and existence (Wujud). He argued that the fact of existence can not be inferred from or accounted for by the essence of existing things, and that form and matter by themselves cannot interact and originate the movement of the universe or the progressive actualization of existing things. Existence must, therefore, be due to an agent-cause that necessitates, imparts, gives, or adds existence to an essence. To do so, the cause must be an existing thing and coexist with its effect.\n\nQuestion: Who followed Avicenna's leadand investigated the question of being?\n\nAnswer:  unanswerable\n\nTitle: LaserDisc\n\nBackground: LaserDiscs potentially had a much longer lifespan than videocassettes. Because the discs were read optically instead of magnetically, no physical contact needs to be made between the player and the disc, except for the player's clamp that holds the disc at its center as it is spun and read. As a result, playback would not wear the information-bearing part of the discs, and properly manufactured LDs would theoretically last beyond one's lifetime. By contrast, a VHS tape held all of its picture and sound information on the tape in a magnetic coating which is in contact with the spinning heads on the head drum, causing progressive wear with each use (though later in VHS's lifespan, engineering improvements allowed tapes to be made and played back without contact).

The morning loop consists of CCA1 (Circadian and Clock-Associated 1) and LHY (Late Elongated Hypocotyl), which encode closely related MYB transcription factors that regulate circadian rhythms in Arabidopsis, as well as PRR 7 and 9 (Pseudo-Response Regulators.) The evening loop consists of GI (Gigantea) and ELF4, both involved in regulation of flowering time genes. When CCA1 and LHY are overexpressed (under constant light or dark conditions), plants become arrhythmic, and mRNA signals reduce, contributing to a negative feedback loop. Gene expression of CCA1 and LHY oscillates and peaks in the early morning, whereas TOC1 gene expression oscillates and peaks in the early evening. While it was previously hypothesised that these three genes model a negative feedback loop in which over-expressed CCA1 and LHY repress TOC1 and over-expressed TOC1 is a positive regulator of CCA1 and LHY, it was shown in 2012 by Andrew Millar and others that TOC1 in fact serves as a repressor not only of CCA1, LHY, and PRR7 and 9 in the morning loop but also of GI and ELF4 in the evening loop. This finding and further computational modeling of TOC1 gene functions and interactions suggest a reframing of the plant circadian clock as a triple negative-component repressilator model rather than the positive/negative-element feedback loop characterizing the clock in mammals.\n\nQuestion: What was the previous belief of feedback in the gene loop?\n\nAnswer:  negative feedback loop\n\nTitle: Daylight_saving_time\n\nBackground: Daylight saving time (DST) or summer time is the practice of advancing clocks during summer months by one hour so that in the evening daylight is experienced an hour longer, while sacrificing normal sunrise times.

They are intended to implement simplification of administration at that level. Typically, a district-free city or town and its urban hinterland are grouped into such an association, or Kommunalverband besonderer Art.

She personally donated \u00a32,000 to famine relief, more than any other individual donor, and also supported the Maynooth Grant to a Roman Catholic seminary in Ireland, despite Protestant opposition. The story that she donated only \u00a35 in aid to the Irish, and on the same day gave the same amount to Battersea Dogs Home, was a myth generated towards the end of the 19th century.\n\nQuestion: How many people died during the Great Famine in Ireland?\n\nAnswer:  over a million\n\nTitle: Normans\n\nBackground: The Norman dynasty had a major political, cultural and military impact on medieval Europe and even the Near East.

The term \"Second Hundred Years' War\" has been used in order to describe the almost continuous level of world-wide conflict during the entire 18th century, reminiscent of the more famous and compact struggle of the 14th century.\n\nQuestion: What is the grandest label that historians have used to describe the  Seven Years' War?\n\nAnswer:  The war has been described as the first \"world war\"\n\nTitle: Normans\n\nBackground: The Norman dynasty had a major political, cultural and military impact on medieval Europe and even the Near East. The Normans were famed for their martial spirit and eventually for their Christian piety, becoming exponents of the Catholic orthodoxy into which they assimilated. They adopted the Gallo-Romance language of the Frankish land they settled, their dialect becoming known as Norman, Normaund or Norman French, an important literary language. The Duchy of Normandy, which they formed by treaty with the French crown, was a great fief of medieval France, and under Richard I of Normandy was forged into a cohesive and formidable principality in feudal tenure. The Normans are noted both for their culture, such as their unique Romanesque architecture and musical traditions, and for their significant military accomplishments and innovations. Norman adventurers founded the Kingdom of Sicily under Roger II after conquering southern Italy on the Saracens and Byzantines, and an expedition on behalf of their duke, William the Conqueror, led to the Norman conquest of England at the Battle of Hastings in 1066. Norman cultural and military influence spread from these new European centres to the Crusader states of the Near East, where their prince Bohemond I founded the Principality of Antioch in the Levant, to Scotland and Wales in Great Britain, to Ireland, and to the coasts of north Africa and the Canary Islands.\n\nQuestion: Who was famed for their Christian spirit?\n\nAnswer:", " unanswerable"]], "resps": [["  unanswerable"], [[-5.703125, false]]], "filtered_resps": ["  unanswerable", [-5.703125, false]], "filter": "none", "metrics": ["exact", "f1", "HasAns_exact", "HasAns_f1", "NoAns_exact", "NoAns_f1", "best_exact", "best_f1"], "doc_hash": "f4cf82b9dc337fd201995f76cc4b900477b517c7c0e9ec4b00124d211b34b577", "prompt_hash": "8cf902e649d6d03633b34b14c5001c8a753c486c1abc0d2378e9413abdabf94d", "target_hash": "a77a7434534bff301720676f050b879d5dcc80c28a20c845042f472eb1790710", "exact": [{"id": "5ad3a266604f3c001a3fea28", "prediction_text": "  unanswerable", "no_answer_probability": 0.0033355256361334625}, {"id": "5ad3a266604f3c001a3fea28", "answers": {"text": [], "answer_start": []}}], "f1": [{"id": "5ad3a266604f3c001a3fea28", "prediction_text": "  unanswerable", "no_answer_probability": 0.0033355256361334625}, {"id": "5ad3a266604f3c001a3fea28", "answers": {"text": [], "answer_start": []}}], "HasAns_exact": [{"id": "5ad3a266604f3c001a3fea28", "prediction_text": "  unanswerable", "no_answer_probability": 0.0033355256361334625}, {"id": "5ad3a266604f3c001a3fea28", "answers": {"text": [], "answer_start": []}}], "HasAns_f1": [{"id": "5ad3a266604f3c001a3fea28", "prediction_text": "  unanswerable", "no_answer_probability": 0.0033355256361334625}, {"id": "5ad3a266604f3c001a3fea28", "answers": {"text": [], "answer_start": []}}], "NoAns_exact": [{"id": "5ad3a266604f3c001a3fea28", "prediction_text": "  unanswerable", "no_answer_probability": 0.0033355256361334625}, {"id": "5ad3a266604f3c001a3fea28", "answers": {"text": [], "answer_start": []}}], "NoAns_f1": [{"id": "5ad3a266604f3c001a3fea28", "prediction_text": "  unanswerable", "no_answer_probability": 0.0033355256361334625}, {"id": "5ad3a266604f3c001a3fea28", "answers": {"text": [], "answer_start": []}}], "best_exact": [{"id": "5ad3a266604f3c001a3fea28", "prediction_text": "  unanswerable", "no_answer_probability": 0.0033355256361334625}, {"id": "5ad3a266604f3c001a3fea28", "answers": {"text": [], "answer_start": []}}], "best_f1": [{"id": "5ad3a266604f3c001a3fea28", "prediction_text": "  unanswerable", "no_answer_probability": 0.0033355256361334625}, {"id": "5ad3a266604f3c001a3fea28", "answers": {"text": [], "answer_start": []}}]}, {"doc_id": 14, "doc": {"id": "5ad3a266604f3c001a3fea29", "title": "Normans", "context": "The Norman dynasty had a major political, cultural and military impact on medieval Europe and even the Near East.

About thirty of Ibn Sina's shorter works are said to have been composed in Rey. Constant feuds which raged between the regent and her second son, Shams al-Daula, however, compelled the scholar to quit the place. After a brief sojourn at Qazvin he passed southwards to Hamad\u00e3n where Shams al-Daula, another Buwayhid emir, had established himself. At first, Ibn Sina entered into the service of a high-born lady; but the emir, hearing of his arrival, called him in as medical attendant, and sent him back with presents to his dwelling. Ibn Sina was even raised to the office of vizier. The emir decreed that he should be banished from the country. Ibn Sina, however, remained hidden for forty days in sheikh Ahmed Fadhel's house, until a fresh attack of illness induced the emir to restore him to his post. Even during this perturbed time, Ibn Sina persevered with his studies and teaching. Every evening, extracts from his great works, the Canon and the Sanatio, were dictated and explained to his pupils. On the death of the emir, Ibn Sina ceased to be vizier and hid himself in the house of an apothecary, where, with intense assiduity, he continued the composition of his works.\n\nQuestion: Who's death made Ibn Sani a vizier?\n\nAnswer:  unanswerable\n\nTitle: Paper\n\nBackground: The density of paper ranges from 250 kg/m3 (16 lb/cu ft) for tissue paper to 1,500 kg/m3 (94 lb/cu ft) for some speciality paper.

The minority of living polychaetes whose reproduction and lifecycles are known produce trochophore larvae, that live as plankton and then sink and metamorphose into miniature adults. Oligochaetes are full hermaphrodites and produce a ring-like cocoon around their bodies, in which the eggs and hatchlings are nourished until they are ready to emerge.\n\nQuestion: What annelids are hermaphrodites?\n\nAnswer:  Oligochaetes\n\nTitle: Macintosh\n\nBackground: In 1982, Regis McKenna was brought in to shape the marketing and launch of the Macintosh. Later the Regis McKenna team grew to include Jane Anderson, Katie Cadigan and Andy Cunningham, who eventually led the Apple account for the agency. Cunningham and Anderson were the primary authors of the Macintosh launch plan. The launch of the Macintosh pioneered many different tactics that are used today in launching technology products, including the \"multiple exclusive,\" event marketing (credited to John Sculley, who brought the concept over from Pepsi), creating a mystique around a product and giving an inside look into a product's creation.\n\nQuestion: What didn't the \"multiple exclusive\" event marketing concept create around a product?\n\nAnswer:  unanswerable\n\nTitle: Thuringia\n\nBackground: Some reordering of the Thuringian states occurred during the German Mediatisation from 1795 to 1814, and the territory was included within the Napoleonic Confederation of the Rhine organized in 1806. The 1815 Congress of Vienna confirmed these changes and the Thuringian states' inclusion in the German Confederation; the Kingdom of Prussia also acquired some Thuringian territory and administered it within the Province of Saxony. The Thuringian duchies which became part of the German Empire in 1871 during the Prussian-led unification of Germany were Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, Saxe-Meiningen, Saxe-Altenburg, Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, Schwarzburg-Sondershausen, Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt and the two principalities of Reuss Elder Line and Reuss Younger Line. In 1920, after World War I, these small states merged into one state, called Thuringia; only Saxe-Coburg voted to join Bavaria instead. Weimar became the new capital of Thuringia.

The security situation did not improve during June\u2013August 2013 and there were reports of over 200,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs) as well as human rights abuses and renewed fighting between S\u00e9l\u00e9ka and Boziz\u00e9 supporters.\n\nQuestion: How many people were displaced in the unrests?\n\nAnswer:  200,000\n\nTitle: Han_dynasty\n\nBackground: Apart from the passing of noble titles or ranks, inheritance practices did not involve primogeniture; each son received an equal share of the family property. Unlike the practice in later dynasties, the father usually sent his adult married sons away with their portions of the family fortune. Daughters received a portion of the family fortune through their marriage dowries, though this was usually much less than the shares of sons. A different distribution of the remainder could be specified in a will, but it is unclear how common this was.\n\nQuestion: Was is guaranteed that a first born son would receive all of the family's fortune?\n\nAnswer:  inheritance practices did not involve primogeniture\n\nTitle: Buddhism\n\nBackground: Within Buddhism, samsara is defined as the continual repetitive cycle of birth and death that arises from ordinary beings' grasping and fixating on a self and experiences. Specifically, samsara refers to the process of cycling through one rebirth after another within the six realms of existence,[note 2] where each realm can be understood as physical realm or a psychological state characterized by a particular type of suffering.

Unlike the practice in later dynasties, the father usually sent his adult married sons away with their portions of the family fortune. Daughters received a portion of the family fortune through their marriage dowries, though this was usually much less than the shares of sons. A different distribution of the remainder could be specified in a will, but it is unclear how common this was.\n\nQuestion: Was is guaranteed that a first born son would receive all of the family's fortune?\n\nAnswer:  inheritance practices did not involve primogeniture\n\nTitle: Buddhism\n\nBackground: Within Buddhism, samsara is defined as the continual repetitive cycle of birth and death that arises from ordinary beings' grasping and fixating on a self and experiences. Specifically, samsara refers to the process of cycling through one rebirth after another within the six realms of existence,[note 2] where each realm can be understood as physical realm or a psychological state characterized by a particular type of suffering.

Cossacks were warriors organized into military communities, resembling pirates and pioneers of the New World. In 1648, the peasants of Ukraine joined the Zaporozhian Cossacks in rebellion against Poland-Lithuania during the Khmelnytsky Uprising, because of the social and religious oppression they suffered under Polish rule. In 1654 the Ukrainian leader, Bohdan Khmelnytsky, offered to place Ukraine under the protection of the Russian Tsar, Aleksey I. Aleksey's acceptance of this offer led to another Russo-Polish War (1654\u20131667). Finally, Ukraine was split along the river Dnieper, leaving the western part (or Right-bank Ukraine) under Polish rule and eastern part (Left-bank Ukraine and Kiev) under Russian. Later, in 1670\u201371 the Don Cossacks led by Stenka Razin initiated a major uprising in the Volga region, but the Tsar's troops were successful in defeating the rebels. In the east, the rapid Russian exploration and colonisation of the huge territories of Siberia was led mostly by Cossacks hunting for valuable furs and ivory. Russian explorers pushed eastward primarily along the Siberian river routes, and by the mid-17th century there were Russian settlements in the Eastern Siberia, on the Chukchi Peninsula, along the Amur River, and on the Pacific coast. In 1648 the Bering Strait between Asia and North America was passed for the first time by Fedot Popov and Semyon Dezhnyov.\n\nQuestion: Who joined the Cossacks in 1648?\n\nAnswer:  peasants of Ukraine\n\nTitle: Law_of_the_United_States\n\nBackground: Unlike the situation with the states, there is no plenary reception statute at the federal level that continued the common law and thereby granted federal courts the power to formulate legal precedent like their English predecessors. Federal courts are solely creatures of the federal Constitution and the federal Judiciary Acts. However, it is universally accepted that the Founding Fathers of the United States, by vesting \"judicial power\" into the Supreme Court and the inferior federal courts in Article Three of the United States Constitution, thereby vested in them the implied judicial power of common law courts to formulate persuasive precedent; this power was widely accepted, understood, and recognized by the Founding Fathers at the time the Constitution was ratified. Several legal scholars have argued that the federal judicial power to decide \"cases or controversies\" necessarily includes the power to decide the precedential effect of those cases and controversies.\n\nQuestion: When did scholars begin to argue that judicial power includes precedential effect?\n\nAnswer:  unanswerable\n\nTitle: Cotton\n\nBackground: While Brazil was fighting the US through the WTO's Dispute Settlement Mechanism against a heavily subsidized cotton industry, a group of four least-developed African countries \u2013 Benin, Burkina Faso, Chad, and Mali \u2013 also known as \"Cotton-4\" have been the leading protagonist for the reduction of US cotton subsidies through negotiations. The four introduced a \"Sectoral Initiative in Favour of Cotton\", presented by Burkina Faso's President Blaise Compaor\u00e9 during the Trade Negotiations Committee on 10 June 2003.\n\nQuestion: What has the Cotton-4 been in regards to the US cotton subsidies?\n\nAnswer:  leading protagonist\n\nTitle: American_Idol\n\nBackground: In the audition rounds, 121 contestants were selected from around 10,000 who attended the auditions. These were cut to 30 for the semifinal, with ten going on to the finals. One semifinalist, Delano Cagnolatti, was disqualified for lying to evade the show's age limit. One of the early favorites, Tamyra Gray, was eliminated at the top four, the first of several such shock eliminations that were to be repeated in later seasons. Christina Christian was hospitalized before the top six result show due to chest pains and palpitations, and she was eliminated while she was in the hospital. Jim Verraros was the first openly gay contestant on the show; his sexual orientation was revealed in his online journal, however it was removed during the competition after a request from the show producers over concerns that it might be unfairly influencing votes.\n\nQuestion: Who was eliminated while she was in the hospital due to chest pains?\n\nAnswer:  Christina Christian\n\nTitle: Normans\n\nBackground: The English name \"Normans\" comes from the French words Normans/Normanz, plural of Normant, modern French normand, which is itself borrowed from Old Low Franconian Nortmann \"Northman\" or directly from Old Norse Nor\u00f0ma\u00f0r, Latinized variously as Nortmannus, Normannus, or Nordmannus (recorded in Medieval Latin, 9th century) to mean \"Norseman, Viking\".\n\nQuestion: When was the Latin version of the word Norman first recorded?\n\nAnswer:", {"until": ["\n"]}], ["Title: Dell\n\nBackground: Dell traces its origins to 1984, when Michael Dell created Dell Computer Corporation, which at the time did business as PC's Limited, while a student of the University of Texas at Austin.

In 1648, the peasants of Ukraine joined the Zaporozhian Cossacks in rebellion against Poland-Lithuania during the Khmelnytsky Uprising, because of the social and religious oppression they suffered under Polish rule. In 1654 the Ukrainian leader, Bohdan Khmelnytsky, offered to place Ukraine under the protection of the Russian Tsar, Aleksey I. Aleksey's acceptance of this offer led to another Russo-Polish War (1654\u20131667). Finally, Ukraine was split along the river Dnieper, leaving the western part (or Right-bank Ukraine) under Polish rule and eastern part (Left-bank Ukraine and Kiev) under Russian. Later, in 1670\u201371 the Don Cossacks led by Stenka Razin initiated a major uprising in the Volga region, but the Tsar's troops were successful in defeating the rebels. In the east, the rapid Russian exploration and colonisation of the huge territories of Siberia was led mostly by Cossacks hunting for valuable furs and ivory. Russian explorers pushed eastward primarily along the Siberian river routes, and by the mid-17th century there were Russian settlements in the Eastern Siberia, on the Chukchi Peninsula, along the Amur River, and on the Pacific coast. In 1648 the Bering Strait between Asia and North America was passed for the first time by Fedot Popov and Semyon Dezhnyov.\n\nQuestion: Who joined the Cossacks in 1648?\n\nAnswer:  peasants of Ukraine\n\nTitle: Law_of_the_United_States\n\nBackground: Unlike the situation with the states, there is no plenary reception statute at the federal level that continued the common law and thereby granted federal courts the power to formulate legal precedent like their English predecessors. Federal courts are solely creatures of the federal Constitution and the federal Judiciary Acts. However, it is universally accepted that the Founding Fathers of the United States, by vesting \"judicial power\" into the Supreme Court and the inferior federal courts in Article Three of the United States Constitution, thereby vested in them the implied judicial power of common law courts to formulate persuasive precedent; this power was widely accepted, understood, and recognized by the Founding Fathers at the time the Constitution was ratified. Several legal scholars have argued that the federal judicial power to decide \"cases or controversies\" necessarily includes the power to decide the precedential effect of those cases and controversies.\n\nQuestion: When did scholars begin to argue that judicial power includes precedential effect?\n\nAnswer:  unanswerable\n\nTitle: Cotton\n\nBackground: While Brazil was fighting the US through the WTO's Dispute Settlement Mechanism against a heavily subsidized cotton industry, a group of four least-developed African countries \u2013 Benin, Burkina Faso, Chad, and Mali \u2013 also known as \"Cotton-4\" have been the leading protagonist for the reduction of US cotton subsidies through negotiations. The four introduced a \"Sectoral Initiative in Favour of Cotton\", presented by Burkina Faso's President Blaise Compaor\u00e9 during the Trade Negotiations Committee on 10 June 2003.\n\nQuestion: What has the Cotton-4 been in regards to the US cotton subsidies?\n\nAnswer:  leading protagonist\n\nTitle: American_Idol\n\nBackground: In the audition rounds, 121 contestants were selected from around 10,000 who attended the auditions. These were cut to 30 for the semifinal, with ten going on to the finals. One semifinalist, Delano Cagnolatti, was disqualified for lying to evade the show's age limit. One of the early favorites, Tamyra Gray, was eliminated at the top four, the first of several such shock eliminations that were to be repeated in later seasons. Christina Christian was hospitalized before the top six result show due to chest pains and palpitations, and she was eliminated while she was in the hospital. Jim Verraros was the first openly gay contestant on the show; his sexual orientation was revealed in his online journal, however it was removed during the competition after a request from the show producers over concerns that it might be unfairly influencing votes.\n\nQuestion: Who was eliminated while she was in the hospital due to chest pains?\n\nAnswer:  Christina Christian\n\nTitle: Normans\n\nBackground: The English name \"Normans\" comes from the French words Normans/Normanz, plural of Normant, modern French normand, which is itself borrowed from Old Low Franconian Nortmann \"Northman\" or directly from Old Norse Nor\u00f0ma\u00f0r, Latinized variously as Nortmannus, Normannus, or Nordmannus (recorded in Medieval Latin, 9th century) to mean \"Norseman, Viking\".\n\nQuestion: When was the Latin version of the word Norman first recorded?\n\nAnswer:", " unanswerable"]], "resps": [["  Norman"], [[-6.5859375, false]]], "filtered_resps": ["  Norman", [-6.5859375, false]], "filter": "none", "metrics": ["exact", "f1", "HasAns_exact", "HasAns_f1", "NoAns_exact", "NoAns_f1", "best_exact", "best_f1"], "doc_hash": "76bedb35b74d4fc88e33fd2ac385fee55e0b4606fe9e451d3e00fc7e324198a2", "prompt_hash": "62019ebe8f5609286c82a1df9251ba48b9e71955d4bc0e1d5240f45b569328d5", "target_hash": "838cb798e27d947911e08a4e51337af8121fb6cf185ece2d232809aa937d5c67", "exact": [{"id": "56dde0379a695914005b9637", "prediction_text": "  Norman", "no_answer_probability": 0.0013796333548566381}, {"id": "56dde0379a695914005b9637", "answers": {"text": ["9th century", "9th century", "9th century"], "answer_start": [309, 309, 309]}}], "f1": [{"id": "56dde0379a695914005b9637", "prediction_text": "  Norman", "no_answer_probability": 0.0013796333548566381}, {"id": "56dde0379a695914005b9637", "answers": {"text": ["9th century", "9th century", "9th century"], "answer_start": [309, 309, 309]}}], "HasAns_exact": [{"id": "56dde0379a695914005b9637", "prediction_text": "  Norman", "no_answer_probability": 0.0013796333548566381}, {"id": "56dde0379a695914005b9637", "answers": {"text": ["9th century", "9th century", "9th century"], "answer_start": [309, 309, 309]}}], "HasAns_f1": [{"id": "56dde0379a695914005b9637", "prediction_text": "  Norman", "no_answer_probability": 0.0013796333548566381}, {"id": "56dde0379a695914005b9637", "answers": {"text": ["9th century", "9th century", "9th century"], "answer_start": [309, 309, 309]}}], "NoAns_exact": [{"id": "56dde0379a695914005b9637", "prediction_text": "  Norman", "no_answer_probability": 0.0013796333548566381}, {"id": "56dde0379a695914005b9637", "answers": {"text": ["9th century", "9th century", "9th century"], "answer_start": [309, 309, 309]}}], "NoAns_f1": [{"id": "56dde0379a695914005b9637", "prediction_text": "  Norman", "no_answer_probability": 0.0013796333548566381}, {"id": "56dde0379a695914005b9637", "answers": {"text": ["9th century", "9th century", "9th century"], "answer_start": [309, 309, 309]}}], "best_exact": [{"id": "56dde0379a695914005b9637", "prediction_text": "  Norman", "no_answer_probability": 0.0013796333548566381}, {"id": "56dde0379a695914005b9637", "answers": {"text": ["9th century", "9th century", "9th century"], "answer_start": [309, 309, 309]}}], "best_f1": [{"id": "56dde0379a695914005b9637", "prediction_text": "  Norman", "no_answer_probability": 0.0013796333548566381}, {"id": "56dde0379a695914005b9637", "answers": {"text": ["9th century", "9th century", "9th century"], "answer_start": [309, 309, 309]}}]}, {"doc_id": 19, "doc": {"id": "5ad3ab70604f3c001a3feb89", "title": "Normans", "context": "The English name \"Normans\" comes from the French words Normans/Normanz, plural of Normant, modern French normand, which is itself borrowed from Old Low Franconian Nortmann \"Northman\" or directly from Old Norse Nor\u00f0ma\u00f0r, Latinized variously as Nortmannus, Normannus, or Nordmannus (recorded in Medieval Latin, 9th century) to mean \"Norseman, Viking\".", "question": "What name comes from the English words Normans/Normanz?", "answers": {"text": [], "answer_start": []}}, "target": " unanswerable", "arguments": [["Title: Separation_of_church_and_state_in_the_United_States\n\nBackground: The phrase \"[A] hedge or wall of separation between the garden of the church and the wilderness of the world\" was first used by Baptist theologian Roger Williams, the founder of the colony of Rhode Island, in his 1644 book The Bloody Tenent of Persecution.

It had been the world's largest exporter of rice. Myanmar also had a wealth of natural and labour resources. British Burma began exporting crude oil in 1853, making it one of the earliest petroleum producers in the world. It produced 75% of the world's teak and had a highly literate population.

Opposing players may try to regain control of the ball by intercepting a pass or through tackling the opponent in possession of the ball; however, physical contact between opponents is restricted. Football is generally a free-flowing game, with play stopping only when the ball has left the field of play or when play is stopped by the referee for an infringement of the rules. After a stoppage, play recommences with a specified restart.\n\nQuestion: When is play not allowed to be stopped?\n\nAnswer:  unanswerable\n\nTitle: Modern_history\n\nBackground: The major European powers laid claim to the areas of Africa where they could exhibit a sphere of influence over the area. These claims did not have to have any substantial land holdings or treaties to be legitimate. The European power that demonstrated its control over a territory accepted the mandate to rule that region as a national colony. The European nation that held the claim developed and benefited from their colony\u2019s commercial interests without having to fear rival European competition. With the colonial claim came the underlying assumption that the European power that exerted control would use its mandate to offer protection and provide welfare for its colonial peoples, however, this principle remained more theory than practice.

Most German East Prussians, Masurians, Kursieniki, and Lietuvininkai were Lutheran, while the population of Ermland was mainly Roman Catholic due to the history of its bishopric. The East Prussian Jewish Congregation declined from about 9,000 in 1933 to 3,000 in 1939, as most fled from Nazi rule.

Spielberg's early science-fiction and adventure films were seen as archetypes of modern Hollywood blockbuster filmmaking. In later years, his films began addressing humanistic issues such as the Holocaust (in Schindler's List), the transatlantic slave trade (in Amistad), war (in Empire of the Sun, Saving Private Ryan, War Horse and Bridge of Spies) and terrorism (in Munich). His other films include Close Encounters of the Third Kind, the Indiana Jones film series, and A.I.

The team played its first two seasons more than 60 miles away at Greensboro Coliseum while its home arena, Raleigh Entertainment and Sports Arena (later RBC Center and now PNC Arena), was under construction. The Hurricanes are the only major league (NFL, NHL, NBA, MLB) professional sports team in North Carolina to have won a championship, winning the Stanley Cup in 2006, over the Edmonton Oilers. The city played host to the 2011 NHL All-Star Game.\n\nQuestion: What did PNC change it's name to?\n\nAnswer:  unanswerable\n\nTitle: Transistor\n\nBackground: Providing sufficient base drive current is a key problem in the use of bipolar transistors as switches. The transistor provides current gain, allowing a relatively large current in the collector to be switched by a much smaller current into the base terminal. The ratio of these currents varies depending on the type of transistor, and even for a particular type, varies depending on the collector current. In the example light-switch circuit shown, the resistor is chosen to provide enough base current to ensure the transistor will be saturated.\n\nQuestion: If the type of transistor is the same what determines the current ratio?\n\nAnswer:  collector current\n\nTitle: Germans\n\nBackground: Following the defeat in World War I, influence of German-speaking elites over Central and Eastern Europe was greatly limited. At the treaty of Versailles Germany was substantially reduced in size. Austria-Hungary was split up. Rump-Austria, which to a certain extent corresponded to the German-speaking areas of Austria-Hungary (a complete split into language groups was impossible due to multi-lingual areas and language-exclaves) adopted the name \"German-Austria\" (German: Deutsch\u00f6sterreich). The name German-Austria was forbidden by the victorious powers of World War I.

This material would have been more durable than paper in the tropical climate of Southeast Asia.\n\nQuestion: In what direction were the writings on a palm leaf?\n\nAnswer:  longitudinally\n\nTitle: East_Prussia\n\nBackground: In 1939 East Prussia had 2.49 million inhabitants, 85% of them ethnic Germans, the others Poles in the south who, according to Polish estimates numbered in the interwar period around 300,000-350,000, the Latvian speaking Kursenieki, and Lietuvininkai who spoke Lithuanian in the northeast. Most German East Prussians, Masurians, Kursieniki, and Lietuvininkai were Lutheran, while the population of Ermland was mainly Roman Catholic due to the history of its bishopric. The East Prussian Jewish Congregation declined from about 9,000 in 1933 to 3,000 in 1939, as most fled from Nazi rule. Those who remained were later deported and killed in the Holocaust.\n\nQuestion: How many Latvian speaking Kursenieki were there?\n\nAnswer:  unanswerable\n\nTitle: Steven_Spielberg\n\nBackground: In a career spanning more than four decades, Spielberg's films have covered many themes and genres. Spielberg's early science-fiction and adventure films were seen as archetypes of modern Hollywood blockbuster filmmaking. In later years, his films began addressing humanistic issues such as the Holocaust (in Schindler's List), the transatlantic slave trade (in Amistad), war (in Empire of the Sun, Saving Private Ryan, War Horse and Bridge of Spies) and terrorism (in Munich). His other films include Close Encounters of the Third Kind, the Indiana Jones film series, and A.I. Artificial Intelligence.\n\nQuestion: In what film did Spielberg cover the slave trade?\n\nAnswer:  Amistad\n\nTitle: Raleigh,_North_Carolina\n\nBackground: The National Hockey League's Carolina Hurricanes franchise moved to Raleigh in 1997 from Hartford, Connecticut (where it was known as the Hartford Whalers). The team played its first two seasons more than 60 miles away at Greensboro Coliseum while its home arena, Raleigh Entertainment and Sports Arena (later RBC Center and now PNC Arena), was under construction. The Hurricanes are the only major league (NFL, NHL, NBA, MLB) professional sports team in North Carolina to have won a championship, winning the Stanley Cup in 2006, over the Edmonton Oilers. The city played host to the 2011 NHL All-Star Game.\n\nQuestion: What did PNC change it's name to?\n\nAnswer:  unanswerable\n\nTitle: Transistor\n\nBackground: Providing sufficient base drive current is a key problem in the use of bipolar transistors as switches. The transistor provides current gain, allowing a relatively large current in the collector to be switched by a much smaller current into the base terminal. The ratio of these currents varies depending on the type of transistor, and even for a particular type, varies depending on the collector current. In the example light-switch circuit shown, the resistor is chosen to provide enough base current to ensure the transistor will be saturated.\n\nQuestion: If the type of transistor is the same what determines the current ratio?\n\nAnswer:  collector current\n\nTitle: Germans\n\nBackground: Following the defeat in World War I, influence of German-speaking elites over Central and Eastern Europe was greatly limited. At the treaty of Versailles Germany was substantially reduced in size. Austria-Hungary was split up. Rump-Austria, which to a certain extent corresponded to the German-speaking areas of Austria-Hungary (a complete split into language groups was impossible due to multi-lingual areas and language-exclaves) adopted the name \"German-Austria\" (German: Deutsch\u00f6sterreich). The name German-Austria was forbidden by the victorious powers of World War I. Volga Germans living in the Soviet Union were interned in gulags or forcibly relocated during the Second World War.\n\nQuestion: What treaty increased Germanium size?\n\nAnswer:  unanswerable\n\nTitle: Normans\n\nBackground: The English name \"Normans\" comes from the French words Normans/Normanz, plural of Normant, modern French normand, which is itself borrowed from Old Low Franconian Nortmann \"Northman\" or directly from Old Norse Nor\u00f0ma\u00f0r, Latinized variously as Nortmannus, Normannus, or Nordmannus (recorded in Medieval Latin, 9th century) to mean \"Norseman, Viking\".\n\nQuestion: When was the French version of the word Norman first recorded?\n\nAnswer:", " unanswerable"]], "resps": [["  unanswerable"], [[-8.4296875, false]]], "filtered_resps": ["  unanswerable", [-8.4296875, false]], "filter": "none", "metrics": ["exact", "f1", "HasAns_exact", "HasAns_f1", "NoAns_exact", "NoAns_f1", "best_exact", "best_f1"], "doc_hash": "8ba0a78d1a5ab840f8bc7b467500b888e10a559388965f3aabd6f81353d35a8e", "prompt_hash": "ce52a8d473e9e1548a32d1497806fe4097b19e47f86ae5eb708f9b58779984a2", "target_hash": "a77a7434534bff301720676f050b879d5dcc80c28a20c845042f472eb1790710", "exact": [{"id": "5ad3ab70604f3c001a3feb8a", "prediction_text": "  unanswerable", "no_answer_probability": 0.000218289695262571}, {"id": "5ad3ab70604f3c001a3feb8a", "answers": {"text": [], "answer_start": []}}], "f1": [{"id": "5ad3ab70604f3c001a3feb8a", "prediction_text": "  unanswerable", "no_answer_probability": 0.000218289695262571}, {"id": "5ad3ab70604f3c001a3feb8a", "answers": {"text": [], "answer_start": []}}], "HasAns_exact": [{"id": "5ad3ab70604f3c001a3feb8a", "prediction_text": "  unanswerable", "no_answer_probability": 0.000218289695262571}, {"id": "5ad3ab70604f3c001a3feb8a", "answers": {"text": [], "answer_start": []}}], "HasAns_f1": [{"id": "5ad3ab70604f3c001a3feb8a", "prediction_text": "  unanswerable", "no_answer_probability": 0.000218289695262571}, {"id": "5ad3ab70604f3c001a3feb8a", "answers": {"text": [], "answer_start": []}}], "NoAns_exact": [{"id": "5ad3ab70604f3c001a3feb8a", "prediction_text": "  unanswerable", "no_answer_probability": 0.000218289695262571}, {"id": "5ad3ab70604f3c001a3feb8a", "answers": {"text": [], "answer_start": []}}], "NoAns_f1": [{"id": "5ad3ab70604f3c001a3feb8a", "prediction_text": "  unanswerable", "no_answer_probability": 0.000218289695262571}, {"id": "5ad3ab70604f3c001a3feb8a", "answers": {"text": [], "answer_start": []}}], "best_exact": [{"id": "5ad3ab70604f3c001a3feb8a", "prediction_text": "  unanswerable", "no_answer_probability": 0.000218289695262571}, {"id": "5ad3ab70604f3c001a3feb8a", "answers": {"text": [], "answer_start": []}}], "best_f1": [{"id": "5ad3ab70604f3c001a3feb8a", "prediction_text": "  unanswerable", "no_answer_probability": 0.000218289695262571}, {"id": "5ad3ab70604f3c001a3feb8a", "answers": {"text": [], "answer_start": []}}]}, {"doc_id": 21, "doc": {"id": "56dde0ba66d3e219004dad75", "title": "Normans", "context": "In the course of the 10th century, the initially destructive incursions of Norse war bands into the rivers of France evolved into more permanent encampments that included local women and personal property.

At standard temperature and pressure, hydrogen is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, non-toxic, nonmetallic, highly combustible diatomic gas with the molecular formula H2. Since hydrogen readily forms covalent compounds with most non-metallic elements, most of the hydrogen on Earth exists in molecular forms such as in the form of water or organic compounds. Hydrogen plays a particularly important role in acid\u2013base reactions as many acid-base reactions involve the exchange of protons between soluble molecules. In ionic compounds, hydrogen can take the form of a negative charge (i.e., anion) when it is known as a hydride, or as a positively charged (i.e., cation) species denoted by the symbol H+. The hydrogen cation is written as though composed of a bare proton, but in reality, hydrogen cations in ionic compounds are always more complex species than that would suggest. As the only neutral atom for which the Schr\u00f6dinger equation can be solved analytically, study of the energetics and bonding of the hydrogen atom has played a key role in the development of quantum mechanics.\n\nQuestion: What form can you find hydrogen is on Earth?\n\nAnswer:  molecular\n\nTitle: Bras%C3%ADlia\n\nBackground: The major roles of construction and of services (government, communications, banking and finance, food production, entertainment, and legal services) in Bras\u00edlia's economy reflect the city's status as a governmental rather than an industrial center.

Soviet investment in and support of Armenian industry has virtually disappeared, so that few major enterprises are still able to function. In addition, the effects of the 1988 Spitak earthquake, which killed more than 25,000 people and made 500,000 homeless, are still being felt. The conflict with Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh has not been resolved. The closure of Azerbaijani and Turkish borders has devastated the economy, because Armenia depends on outside supplies of energy and most raw materials. Land routes through Georgia and Iran are inadequate or unreliable. The GDP fell nearly 60% between 1989 and 1993, but then resumed robust growth. The national currency, the dram, suffered hyperinflation for the first years after its introduction in 1993.\n\nQuestion: How much did the Armenian GDP decrease from 1989-1993\n\nAnswer:  60%\n\nTitle: Normans\n\nBackground: In the course of the 10th century, the initially destructive incursions of Norse war bands into the rivers of France evolved into more permanent encampments that included local women and personal property. The Duchy of Normandy, which began in 911 as a fiefdom, was established by the treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte between King Charles III of West Francia and the famed Viking ruler Rollo, and was situated in the former Frankish kingdom of Neustria. The treaty offered Rollo and his men the French lands between the river Epte and the Atlantic coast in exchange for their protection against further Viking incursions. The area corresponded to the northern part of present-day Upper Normandy down to the river Seine, but the Duchy would eventually extend west beyond the Seine. The territory was roughly equivalent to the old province of Rouen, and reproduced the Roman administrative structure of Gallia Lugdunensis II (part of the former Gallia Lugdunensis).\n\nQuestion: Who did Rollo sign the treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte with?\n\nAnswer:", {"until": ["\n"]}], ["Title: Hydrogen\n\nBackground: The universal emergence of atomic hydrogen first occurred during the recombination epoch. At standard temperature and pressure, hydrogen is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, non-toxic, nonmetallic, highly combustible diatomic gas with the molecular formula H2. Since hydrogen readily forms covalent compounds with most non-metallic elements, most of the hydrogen on Earth exists in molecular forms such as in the form of water or organic compounds. Hydrogen plays a particularly important role in acid\u2013base reactions as many acid-base reactions involve the exchange of protons between soluble molecules. In ionic compounds, hydrogen can take the form of a negative charge (i.e., anion) when it is known as a hydride, or as a positively charged (i.e., cation) species denoted by the symbol H+. The hydrogen cation is written as though composed of a bare proton, but in reality, hydrogen cations in ionic compounds are always more complex species than that would suggest. As the only neutral atom for which the Schr\u00f6dinger equation can be solved analytically, study of the energetics and bonding of the hydrogen atom has played a key role in the development of quantum mechanics.\n\nQuestion: What form can you find hydrogen is on Earth?\n\nAnswer:  molecular\n\nTitle: Bras%C3%ADlia\n\nBackground: The major roles of construction and of services (government, communications, banking and finance, food production, entertainment, and legal services) in Bras\u00edlia's economy reflect the city's status as a governmental rather than an industrial center. Industries connected with construction, food processing, and furnishings are important, as are those associated with publishing, printing, and computer software.

In addition to the dollar the coinage act officially established monetary units of mill or one-thousandth of a dollar (symbol \u20a5), cent or one-hundredth of a dollar (symbol \u00a2), dime or one-tenth of a dollar, and eagle or ten dollars, with prescribed weights and composition of gold, silver, or copper for each. It was proposed in the mid-1800s that one hundred dollars be known as a union, but no union coins were ever struck and only patterns for the $50 half union exist. However, only cents are in everyday use as divisions of the dollar; \"dime\" is used solely as the name of the coin with the value of 10\u00a2, while \"eagle\" and \"mill\" are largely unknown to the general public, though mills are sometimes used in matters of tax levies, and gasoline prices are usually in the form of $X.XX9 per gallon, e.g., $3.599, sometimes written as $3.599\u204410. When currently issued in circulating form, denominations equal to or less than a dollar are emitted as U.S. coins while denominations equal to or greater than a dollar are emitted as Federal Reserve notes (with the exception of gold, silver and platinum coins valued up to $100 as legal tender, but worth far more as bullion). Both one-dollar coins and notes are produced today, although the note form is significantly more common. In the past, \"paper money\" was occasionally issued in denominations less than a dollar (fractional currency) and gold coins were issued for circulation up to the value of $20 (known as the \"double eagle\", discontinued in the 1930s). The term eagle was used in the Coinage Act of 1792 for the denomination of ten dollars, and subsequently was used in naming gold coins. Paper currency less than one dollar in denomination, known as \"fractional currency\", was also sometimes pejoratively referred to as \"shinplasters\". In 1854, James Guthrie, then Secretary of the Treasury, proposed creating $100, $50 and $25 gold coins, which were referred to as a \"Union\", \"Half Union\", and \"Quarter Union\", thus implying a denomination of 1 Union = $100.\n\nQuestion: What was the maximum value paper money used to be able to have?\n\nAnswer:  unanswerable\n\nTitle: Gamal_Abdel_Nasser\n\nBackground: As political instability grew in Syria, delegations from the country were sent to Nasser demanding immediate unification with Egypt.

It was clear that the result in Ohio, along with two other states who had still not declared (New Mexico and Iowa), would decide the winner. Bush had established a lead of around 130,000 votes but the Democrats pointed to provisional ballots that had yet to be counted, initially reported to number as high as 200,000. Bush had preliminary leads of less than 5% of the vote in only four states, but if Iowa, Nevada and New Mexico had all eventually gone to Kerry, a win for Bush in Ohio would have created a 269\u2013269 tie in the Electoral College. The result of an electoral tie would cause the election to be decided in the House of Representatives with each state casting one vote, regardless of population. Such a scenario would almost certainly have resulted in a victory for Bush, as Republicans controlled more House delegations. Therefore, the outcome of the election hinged solely on the result in Ohio, regardless of the final totals elsewhere. In the afternoon Ohio's Secretary of State, Ken Blackwell, announced that it was statistically impossible for the Democrats to make up enough valid votes in the provisional ballots to win. At the time provisional ballots were reported as numbering 140,000 (and later estimated to be only 135,000). Faced with this announcement, John Kerry conceded defeat.

Fourteen unarmed civilians were killed and hundreds more injured. On the night of July 31, 1991, Russian OMON from Riga, the Soviet military headquarters in the Baltics, assaulted the Lithuanian border post in Medininkai and killed seven Lithuanian servicemen. This event further weakened the Soviet Union's position internationally and domestically, and stiffened Lithuanian resistance.\n\nQuestion: What were the Soviets hoping to stop?\n\nAnswer:  independence movement\n\nTitle: Light-emitting_diode\n\nBackground: A new style of wafers composed of gallium-nitride-on-silicon (GaN-on-Si) is being used to produce white LEDs using 200-mm silicon wafers. This avoids the typical costly sapphire substrate in relatively small 100- or 150-mm wafer sizes. The sapphire apparatus must be coupled with a mirror-like collector to reflect light that would otherwise be wasted. It is predicted that by 2020, 40% of all GaN LEDs will be made with GaN-on-Si. Manufacturing large sapphire material is difficult, while large silicon material is cheaper and more abundant.

On December 3, 1883, the House elected Democrat John G. Carlisle of Kentucky as Speaker. Republicans placed in nomination for the speakership J. Warren Keifer of Ohio, who was Speaker the previous Congress. Clearly, Keifer was not the Republicans' minority leader. He was a discredited leader in part because as Speaker he arbitrarily handed out \"choice jobs to close relatives ... all at handsome salaries.\" Keifer received \"the empty honor of the minority nomination. But with it came a sting -- for while this naturally involves the floor leadership, he was deserted by his [partisan] associates and his career as a national figure terminated ingloriously.\" Representative Thomas Reed, R-ME, who later became Speaker, assumed the de facto role of minority floor leader in Keifer's stead. \"[A]lthough Keifer was the minority's candidate for Speaker, Reed became its acknowledged leader, and ever after, so long as he served in the House, remained the most conspicuous member of his party.\n\nQuestion: Who was Ripley deserted by?\n\nAnswer:  unanswerable\n\nTitle: Aircraft_carrier\n\nBackground: 1 CATOBAR carrier: Charles de Gaulle is a 42,000 tonne nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, commissioned in 2001 and is the flagship of the French Navy (Marine Nationale).

It is a CATOBAR-type carrier that uses two 75 m C13\u20113 steam catapults of a shorter version of the catapult system installed on the U.S. Nimitz-class carriers, one catapult at the bow and one across the front of the landing area.\n\nQuestion: What is another name for the French Navy?\n\nAnswer:  Marine Nationale\n\nTitle: Tajikistan\n\nBackground: During the late 19th Century the Jadidists established themselves as an Islamic social movement throughout the region. Although the Jadidists were pro-modernization and not necessarily anti-Russian the Russians viewed the movement as a threat.[citation needed] Russian troops were required to restore order during uprisings against the Khanate of Kokand between 1910 and 1913. Further violence occurred in July 1916 when demonstrators attacked Russian soldiers in Khujand over the threat of forced conscription during World War I.

The treaty offered Rollo and his men the French lands between the river Epte and the Atlantic coast in exchange for their protection against further Viking incursions. The area corresponded to the northern part of present-day Upper Normandy down to the river Seine, but the Duchy would eventually extend west beyond the Seine. The territory was roughly equivalent to the old province of Rouen, and reproduced the Roman administrative structure of Gallia Lugdunensis II (part of the former Gallia Lugdunensis).\n\nQuestion: What treaty was established in the 9th century?\n\nAnswer:", {"until": ["\n"]}], ["Title: Dissolution_of_the_Soviet_Union\n\nBackground: On January 13, 1991, Soviet troops, along with the KGB Spetsnaz Alpha Group, stormed the Vilnius TV Tower in Lithuania to suppress the independence movement. Fourteen unarmed civilians were killed and hundreds more injured. On the night of July 31, 1991, Russian OMON from Riga, the Soviet military headquarters in the Baltics, assaulted the Lithuanian border post in Medininkai and killed seven Lithuanian servicemen. This event further weakened the Soviet Union's position internationally and domestically, and stiffened Lithuanian resistance.\n\nQuestion: What were the Soviets hoping to stop?\n\nAnswer:  independence movement\n\nTitle: Light-emitting_diode\n\nBackground: A new style of wafers composed of gallium-nitride-on-silicon (GaN-on-Si) is being used to produce white LEDs using 200-mm silicon wafers. This avoids the typical costly sapphire substrate in relatively small 100- or 150-mm wafer sizes. The sapphire apparatus must be coupled with a mirror-like collector to reflect light that would otherwise be wasted. It is predicted that by 2020, 40% of all GaN LEDs will be made with GaN-on-Si. Manufacturing large sapphire material is difficult, while large silicon material is cheaper and more abundant. LED companies shifting from using sapphire to silicon should be a minimal investment.\n\nQuestion:  By using silicon wafers, what is not being avoided?\n\nAnswer:  unanswerable\n\nTitle: Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives\n\nBackground: In the judgment of political scientist Randall Ripley, since 1883 \"the candidate for Speaker nominated by the minority party has clearly been the Minority Leader.\" However, this assertion is subject to dispute. On December 3, 1883, the House elected Democrat John G. Carlisle of Kentucky as Speaker. Republicans placed in nomination for the speakership J. Warren Keifer of Ohio, who was Speaker the previous Congress. Clearly, Keifer was not the Republicans' minority leader. He was a discredited leader in part because as Speaker he arbitrarily handed out \"choice jobs to close relatives ... all at handsome salaries.\" Keifer received \"the empty honor of the minority nomination. But with it came a sting -- for while this naturally involves the floor leadership, he was deserted by his [partisan] associates and his career as a national figure terminated ingloriously.\" Representative Thomas Reed, R-ME, who later became Speaker, assumed the de facto role of minority floor leader in Keifer's stead. \"[A]lthough Keifer was the minority's candidate for Speaker, Reed became its acknowledged leader, and ever after, so long as he served in the House, remained the most conspicuous member of his party.\n\nQuestion: Who was Ripley deserted by?\n\nAnswer:  unanswerable\n\nTitle: Aircraft_carrier\n\nBackground: 1 CATOBAR carrier: Charles de Gaulle is a 42,000 tonne nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, commissioned in 2001 and is the flagship of the French Navy (Marine Nationale). The ship carries a complement of Dassault-Breguet Super \u00c9tendard, Dassault Rafale M and E\u20112C Hawkeye aircraft, EC725 Caracal and AS532 Cougar helicopters for combat search and rescue, as well as modern electronics and Aster missiles. It is a CATOBAR-type carrier that uses two 75 m C13\u20113 steam catapults of a shorter version of the catapult system installed on the U.S. Nimitz-class carriers, one catapult at the bow and one across the front of the landing area.\n\nQuestion: What is another name for the French Navy?\n\nAnswer:  Marine Nationale\n\nTitle: Tajikistan\n\nBackground: During the late 19th Century the Jadidists established themselves as an Islamic social movement throughout the region. Although the Jadidists were pro-modernization and not necessarily anti-Russian the Russians viewed the movement as a threat.[citation needed] Russian troops were required to restore order during uprisings against the Khanate of Kokand between 1910 and 1913. Further violence occurred in July 1916 when demonstrators attacked Russian soldiers in Khujand over the threat of forced conscription during World War I. Despite Russian troops quickly bringing Khujand back under control, clashes continued throughout the year in various locations in Tajikistan.[citation needed]\n\nQuestion: The uprisings against the Khanate of Poland took place between what year?\n\nAnswer:  unanswerable\n\nTitle: Nanjing\n\nBackground: The current economy of the city is basically newly developed based on the past. Service industries are dominating, accounting for about 60 percent of the GDP of the city, and financial industry, culture industry and tourism industry are top 3 of them.

It is somewhat less dense than iron and has a hexagonal crystal structure, with a distorted form of hexagonal close packing, in which each atom has six nearest neighbors (at 265.9 pm) in its own plane and six others at a greater distance of 290.6 pm. The metal is hard and brittle at most temperatures but becomes malleable between 100 and 150 \u00b0C. Above 210 \u00b0C, the metal becomes brittle again and can be pulverized by beating. Zinc is a fair conductor of electricity. For a metal, zinc has relatively low melting (419.5 \u00b0C) and boiling points (907 \u00b0C).

The \"large-sized notes\" issued before 1928 measured 7.42 inches (188 mm) by 3.125 inches (79.4 mm); small-sized notes, introduced that year, measure 6.14 inches (156 mm) by 2.61 inches (66 mm) by 0.0043 inches (0.11 mm).

Japanese forces broke their agreement with the Vichy administration and fighting broke out, ending in a Japanese victory. On 27 September Japan signed a military alliance with Germany and Italy, becoming one of the three Axis Powers.

In some cases, they took on powerful positions in government. In Henry VIII's England, his chief minister was Cardinal Wolsey. Cardinal Richelieu's power was so great that he was for many years effectively the ruler of France. Richelieu successor was also a cardinal, Jules Mazarin. Guillaume Dubois and Andr\u00e9-Hercule de Fleury complete the list of the \"four great\" cardinals to have ruled France.[citation needed] In Portugal, due to a succession crisis, one cardinal, Henry, King of Portugal, was crowned king, the only example of a cardinal-king.\n\nQuestion: What five great cardinals once ruled France?\n\nAnswer:  unanswerable\n\nTitle: Normans\n\nBackground: Before Rollo's arrival, its populations did not differ from Picardy or the \u00cele-de-France, which were considered \"Frankish\".

That exemplar is known as the archetype. \"If we succeed in establishing the text of [the archetype], the constitutio (reconstruction of the original) is considerably advanced.\n\nQuestion: What is the second goal when attempting to analyze a new text?\n\nAnswer:  unanswerable\n\nTitle: United_States_dollar\n\nBackground: Today, USD notes are made from cotton fiber paper, unlike most common paper, which is made of wood fiber. U.S. coins are produced by the United States Mint. U.S. dollar banknotes are printed by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing and, since 1914, have been issued by the Federal Reserve. The \"large-sized notes\" issued before 1928 measured 7.42 inches (188 mm) by 3.125 inches (79.4 mm); small-sized notes, introduced that year, measure 6.14 inches (156 mm) by 2.61 inches (66 mm) by 0.0043 inches (0.11 mm). When the current, smaller sized U.S. currency was introduced it was referred to as Philippine-sized currency because the Philippines had previously adopted the same size for its legal currency.\n\nQuestion: What are Phillipine notes made from now adays?\n\nAnswer:  unanswerable\n\nTitle: Pacific_War\n\nBackground: In September 1940, Japan decided to cut China's only land line to the outside world by seizing Indochina, which was controlled at the time by Vichy France. Japanese forces broke their agreement with the Vichy administration and fighting broke out, ending in a Japanese victory. On 27 September Japan signed a military alliance with Germany and Italy, becoming one of the three Axis Powers. In practice, there was little coordination between Japan and Germany until 1944, by which time the U.S. was deciphering their secret diplomatic correspondence.\n\nQuestion: Who controlled Indochina before the Japanese takeover?\n\nAnswer:  Vichy France\n\nTitle: Cardinal_(Catholicism)\n\nBackground: In early modern times, cardinals often had important roles in secular affairs. In some cases, they took on powerful positions in government. In Henry VIII's England, his chief minister was Cardinal Wolsey. Cardinal Richelieu's power was so great that he was for many years effectively the ruler of France. Richelieu successor was also a cardinal, Jules Mazarin. Guillaume Dubois and Andr\u00e9-Hercule de Fleury complete the list of the \"four great\" cardinals to have ruled France.[citation needed] In Portugal, due to a succession crisis, one cardinal, Henry, King of Portugal, was crowned king, the only example of a cardinal-king.\n\nQuestion: What five great cardinals once ruled France?\n\nAnswer:  unanswerable\n\nTitle: Normans\n\nBackground: Before Rollo's arrival, its populations did not differ from Picardy or the \u00cele-de-France, which were considered \"Frankish\". Earlier Viking settlers had begun arriving in the 880s, but were divided between colonies in the east (Roumois and Pays de Caux) around the low Seine valley and in the west in the Cotentin Peninsula, and were separated by traditional pagii, where the population remained about the same with almost no foreign settlers. Rollo's contingents who raided and ultimately settled Normandy and parts of the Atlantic coast included Danes, Norwegians, Norse\u2013Gaels, Orkney Vikings, possibly Swedes, and Anglo-Danes from the English Danelaw under Norse control.\n\nQuestion: What Viking groups were conquered by Rollo?\n\nAnswer:", " unanswerable"]], "resps": [["  unanswerable"], [[-7.2265625, false]]], "filtered_resps": ["  unanswerable", [-7.2265625, false]], "filter": "none", "metrics": ["exact", "f1", "HasAns_exact", "HasAns_f1", "NoAns_exact", "NoAns_f1", "best_exact", "best_f1"], "doc_hash": "1907e186ca03ea5d900b0a19e7cf6ff9b45adb2b321d49c14055da48fb91aaa5", "prompt_hash": "fd21b99179bb34e8d8f802baf1302debee90469a31dc84fa1072c7f064ca68cf", "target_hash": "a77a7434534bff301720676f050b879d5dcc80c28a20c845042f472eb1790710", "exact": [{"id": "5ad3ae14604f3c001a3fec3a", "prediction_text": "  unanswerable", "no_answer_probability": 0.0007270156891424473}, {"id": "5ad3ae14604f3c001a3fec3a", "answers": {"text": [], "answer_start": []}}], "f1": [{"id": "5ad3ae14604f3c001a3fec3a", "prediction_text": "  unanswerable", "no_answer_probability": 0.0007270156891424473}, {"id": "5ad3ae14604f3c001a3fec3a", "answers": {"text": [], "answer_start": []}}], "HasAns_exact": [{"id": "5ad3ae14604f3c001a3fec3a", "prediction_text": "  unanswerable", "no_answer_probability": 0.0007270156891424473}, {"id": "5ad3ae14604f3c001a3fec3a", "answers": {"text": [], "answer_start": []}}], "HasAns_f1": [{"id": "5ad3ae14604f3c001a3fec3a", "prediction_text": "  unanswerable", "no_answer_probability": 0.0007270156891424473}, {"id": "5ad3ae14604f3c001a3fec3a", "answers": {"text": [], "answer_start": []}}], "NoAns_exact": [{"id": "5ad3ae14604f3c001a3fec3a", "prediction_text": "  unanswerable", "no_answer_probability": 0.0007270156891424473}, {"id": "5ad3ae14604f3c001a3fec3a", "answers": {"text": [], "answer_start": []}}], "NoAns_f1": [{"id": "5ad3ae14604f3c001a3fec3a", "prediction_text": "  unanswerable", "no_answer_probability": 0.0007270156891424473}, {"id": "5ad3ae14604f3c001a3fec3a", "answers": {"text": [], "answer_start": []}}], "best_exact": [{"id": "5ad3ae14604f3c001a3fec3a", "prediction_text": "  unanswerable", "no_answer_probability": 0.0007270156891424473}, {"id": "5ad3ae14604f3c001a3fec3a", "answers": {"text": [], "answer_start": []}}], "best_f1": [{"id": "5ad3ae14604f3c001a3fec3a", "prediction_text": "  unanswerable", "no_answer_probability": 0.0007270156891424473}, {"id": "5ad3ae14604f3c001a3fec3a", "answers": {"text": [], "answer_start": []}}]}, {"doc_id": 31, "doc": {"id": "56dde27d9a695914005b9651", "title": "Normans", "context": "The descendants of Rollo's Vikings and their Frankish wives would replace the Norse religion and Old Norse language with Catholicism (Christianity) and the Gallo-Romance language of the local people, blending their maternal Frankish heritage with Old Norse traditions and customs to synthesize a unique \"Norman\" culture in the north of France.

Still, families who have been in the area of many of the tests are experiencing children with birth defects and physical and mental handicaps and many are asking for a public inquiry. According to the report these tests affected estimated millions of people including one period between 1961 and 1968 where \"more than a million people along the south coast of England, from Torquay to the New Forest, were exposed to bacteria including e.coli and bacillus globigii, which mimics anthrax.\" Two scientists commissioned by the Ministry of Defence stated that these trials posed no risk to the public.

Dutch is taught in various educational centres in Indonesia, the most important of which is the Erasmus Language Centre (ETC) in Jakarta. Each year, some 1,500 to 2,000 students take Dutch courses there. In total, several thousand Indonesians study Dutch as a foreign language.

An exception was the outstanding translation in this period, Edward FitzGerald's Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam (1859), which achieved its Oriental flavor largely by using Persian names and discreet Biblical echoes and actually drew little of its material from the Persian original.\n\nQuestion: How did the translation of Rubaiyat achieve an Oriental flavor?\n\nAnswer:  by using Persian names and discreet Biblical echoes\n\nTitle: Marvel_Comics\n\nBackground: In April 2013, Marvel and other Disney conglomerate components began announcing joint projects.

Mercury dissolves many metals, such as gold, silver, and tin, to form amalgams (an alloy in a soft paste, or liquid form at ambient temperature). Amalgams have been used since 200 BC in China for plating objects with precious metals, called gilding, such as armor and mirrors. The ancient Romans often used mercury-tin amalgams for gilding their armor. The amalgam was applied as a paste and then heated until the mercury vaporized, leaving the gold, silver, or tin behind. Mercury was often used in mining, to extract precious metals like gold and silver from their ores.\n\nQuestion: Since when have Amalgams been used?\n\nAnswer:  200 BC\n\nTitle: England_national_football_team\n\nBackground: England is quite a successful nation at the UEFA European Football Championship, having finished in third place in 1968 and reached the semi-final in 1996. England hosted Euro 96 and have appeared in eight UEFA European Championship Finals tournaments, tied for ninth-best. The team has also reached the quarter-final on two recent occasions in 2004 and 2012. The team's worst result in the competition was a first-round elimination in 1980, 1988, 1992 and 2000. The team did not enter in 1960, and they failed to qualify in 1964, 1972, 1976, 1984, and 2008.\n\nQuestion: In what year was the first UEFA European Football Championship held?\n\nAnswer:  unanswerable\n\nTitle: Modern_history\n\nBackground: The Great Depression ended at different times in different countries with the effect lasting into the next era. America's Great Depression ended in 1941 with America's entry into World War II. The majority of countries set up relief programs, and most underwent some sort of political upheaval, pushing them to the left or right. In some world states, the desperate citizens turned toward nationalist demagogues\u2014the most infamous being Adolf Hitler\u2014setting the stage for the next era of war. The convulsion brought on by the worldwide depression resulted in the rise of Nazism.

In regard to style, the Victorians' aim, achieved through far-reaching metaphrase (literality) or pseudo-metaphrase, was to constantly remind readers that they were reading a foreign classic. An exception was the outstanding translation in this period, Edward FitzGerald's Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam (1859), which achieved its Oriental flavor largely by using Persian names and discreet Biblical echoes and actually drew little of its material from the Persian original.\n\nQuestion: How did the translation of Rubaiyat achieve an Oriental flavor?\n\nAnswer:  by using Persian names and discreet Biblical echoes\n\nTitle: Marvel_Comics\n\nBackground: In April 2013, Marvel and other Disney conglomerate components began announcing joint projects. With ABC, a Once Upon a Time graphic novel was announced for publication in September. With Disney, Marvel announced in October 2013 that in January 2014 it would release its first title under their joint \"Disney Kingdoms\" imprint \"Seekers of the Weird\", a five-issue miniseries. On January 3, 2014, fellow Disney subsidiary Lucasfilm Limited, LLC announced that as of 2015, Star Wars comics would once again be published by Marvel.\n\nQuestion: What series on this network was given a Marvel graphic novel?\n\nAnswer:  Once Upon a Time\n\nTitle: Alloy\n\nBackground: Mercury has been smelted from cinnabar for thousands of years. Mercury dissolves many metals, such as gold, silver, and tin, to form amalgams (an alloy in a soft paste, or liquid form at ambient temperature). Amalgams have been used since 200 BC in China for plating objects with precious metals, called gilding, such as armor and mirrors. The ancient Romans often used mercury-tin amalgams for gilding their armor. The amalgam was applied as a paste and then heated until the mercury vaporized, leaving the gold, silver, or tin behind. Mercury was often used in mining, to extract precious metals like gold and silver from their ores.\n\nQuestion: Since when have Amalgams been used?\n\nAnswer:  200 BC\n\nTitle: England_national_football_team\n\nBackground: England is quite a successful nation at the UEFA European Football Championship, having finished in third place in 1968 and reached the semi-final in 1996. England hosted Euro 96 and have appeared in eight UEFA European Championship Finals tournaments, tied for ninth-best. The team has also reached the quarter-final on two recent occasions in 2004 and 2012. The team's worst result in the competition was a first-round elimination in 1980, 1988, 1992 and 2000. The team did not enter in 1960, and they failed to qualify in 1964, 1972, 1976, 1984, and 2008.\n\nQuestion: In what year was the first UEFA European Football Championship held?\n\nAnswer:  unanswerable\n\nTitle: Modern_history\n\nBackground: The Great Depression ended at different times in different countries with the effect lasting into the next era. America's Great Depression ended in 1941 with America's entry into World War II. The majority of countries set up relief programs, and most underwent some sort of political upheaval, pushing them to the left or right. In some world states, the desperate citizens turned toward nationalist demagogues\u2014the most infamous being Adolf Hitler\u2014setting the stage for the next era of war. The convulsion brought on by the worldwide depression resulted in the rise of Nazism. In Asia, Japan became an ever more assertive power, especially with regards to China.\n\nQuestion: When did Americas Great Depression end?\n\nAnswer:  1941\n\nTitle: Normans\n\nBackground: The descendants of Rollo's Vikings and their Frankish wives would replace the Norse religion and Old Norse language with Catholicism (Christianity) and the Gallo-Romance language of the local people, blending their maternal Frankish heritage with Old Norse traditions and customs to synthesize a unique \"Norman\" culture in the north of France. The Norman language was forged by the adoption of the indigenous langue d'o\u00efl branch of Romance by a Norse-speaking ruling class, and it developed into the regional language that survives today.\n\nQuestion: What part of France were the Normans located?\n\nAnswer:", " unanswerable"]], "resps": [["  the north of France"], [[-6.1640625, false]]], "filtered_resps": ["  the north of France", [-6.1640625, false]], "filter": "none", "metrics": ["exact", "f1", "HasAns_exact", "HasAns_f1", "NoAns_exact", "NoAns_f1", "best_exact", "best_f1"], "doc_hash": "73a2a28151136ff2b58983ede14ecbf6dde8c5fa93306fd0dc25f79ead64b64c", "prompt_hash": "93402033b8acb470ac338413963832683bb7af756e7d393464ab461dbbb5a4f8", "target_hash": "b3b5682be779f3a7f78ec82769db98a1312a84fbabc2c4cb9a05afec857ece55", "exact": [{"id": "56dde27d9a695914005b9652", "prediction_text": "  the north of France", "no_answer_probability": 0.002103689649451823}, {"id": "56dde27d9a695914005b9652", "answers": {"text": ["north", "the north", "north"], "answer_start": [327, 323, 327]}}], "f1": [{"id": "56dde27d9a695914005b9652", "prediction_text": "  the north of France", "no_answer_probability": 0.002103689649451823}, {"id": "56dde27d9a695914005b9652", "answers": {"text": ["north", "the north", "north"], "answer_start": [327, 323, 327]}}], "HasAns_exact": [{"id": "56dde27d9a695914005b9652", "prediction_text": "  the north of France", "no_answer_probability": 0.002103689649451823}, {"id": "56dde27d9a695914005b9652", "answers": {"text": ["north", "the north", "north"], "answer_start": [327, 323, 327]}}], "HasAns_f1": [{"id": "56dde27d9a695914005b9652", "prediction_text": "  the north of France", "no_answer_probability": 0.002103689649451823}, {"id": "56dde27d9a695914005b9652", "answers": {"text": ["north", "the north", "north"], "answer_start": [327, 323, 327]}}], "NoAns_exact": [{"id": "56dde27d9a695914005b9652", "prediction_text": "  the north of France", "no_answer_probability": 0.002103689649451823}, {"id": "56dde27d9a695914005b9652", "answers": {"text": ["north", "the north", "north"], "answer_start": [327, 323, 327]}}], "NoAns_f1": [{"id": "56dde27d9a695914005b9652", "prediction_text": "  the north of France", "no_answer_probability": 0.002103689649451823}, {"id": "56dde27d9a695914005b9652", "answers": {"text": ["north", "the north", "north"], "answer_start": [327, 323, 327]}}], "best_exact": [{"id": "56dde27d9a695914005b9652", "prediction_text": "  the north of France", "no_answer_probability": 0.002103689649451823}, {"id": "56dde27d9a695914005b9652", "answers": {"text": ["north", "the north", "north"], "answer_start": [327, 323, 327]}}], "best_f1": [{"id": "56dde27d9a695914005b9652", "prediction_text": "  the north of France", "no_answer_probability": 0.002103689649451823}, {"id": "56dde27d9a695914005b9652", "answers": {"text": ["north", "the north", "north"], "answer_start": [327, 323, 327]}}]}, {"doc_id": 33, "doc": {"id": "5ad3af11604f3c001a3fec63", "title": "Normans", "context": "The descendants of Rollo's Vikings and their Frankish wives would replace the Norse religion and Old Norse language with Catholicism (Christianity) and the Gallo-Romance language of the local people, blending their maternal Frankish heritage with Old Norse traditions and customs to synthesize a unique \"Norman\" culture in the north of France.

Japanese industrial production plunged as nearly half of the built-up areas of 67 cities were destroyed by B-29 firebombing raids. On 9\u201310 March 1945 alone, about 100,000 people were killed in a conflagration caused by an incendiary attack on Tokyo. LeMay also oversaw Operation Starvation, in which the inland waterways of Japan were extensively mined by air, which disrupted the small amount of remaining Japanese coastal sea traffic. On 26 July 1945, the President of the United States Harry S. Truman, the President of the Nationalist Government of China Chiang Kai-shek and the Prime Minister of Great Britain Winston Churchill issued the Potsdam Declaration, which outlined the terms of surrender for the Empire of Japan as agreed upon at the Potsdam Conference.

Conversely, in the French-speaking regions the local dialects have almost disappeared (only 6.3% of the population of Valais, 3.9% of Fribourg, and 3.1% of Jura still spoke dialects at the end of the 20th century), while in the Italian-speaking regions dialects are mostly limited to family settings and casual conversation.\n\nQuestion: What dialect is increasing in German speaking regions?\n\nAnswer:  Swiss German\n\nTitle: Kievan_Rus%27\n\nBackground: Controversy persists over whether the Rus\u2019 were Varangians (Vikings) or Slavs. This uncertainty is due largely to a paucity of contemporary sources.

To some extent the controversy is related to the foundation myths of modern states in the region. According to the \"Normanist\" view, the Rus' were Scandinavians, while Russian and Ukrainian nationalist historians generally argue that the Rus' were themselves Slavs. Normanist theories focus on the earliest written source for the East Slavs, the Russian Primary Chronicle, although even this account was not produced until the 12th century. Nationalist accounts have suggested that the Rus' were present before the arrival of the Varangians, noting that only a handful of Scandinavian words can be found in modern Russian and that Scandinavian names in the early chronicles were soon replaced by Slavic names. Nevertheless, archaeological evidence from the area suggests that a Scandinavian population was present during the 10th century at the latest. On balance, it seems likely that the Rus' proper were a small minority of Scandinavians who formed an elite ruling class, while the great majority of their subjects were Slavs. Considering the linguistic arguments mounted by nationalist scholars, if the proto-Rus' were Scandinavians, they must have quickly become nativized, adopting Slavic languages and other cultural practices.\n\nQuestion: What did the Russian believe the Rus were not?\n\nAnswer:  unanswerable\n\nTitle: Normans\n\nBackground: The descendants of Rollo's Vikings and their Frankish wives would replace the Norse religion and Old Norse language with Catholicism (Christianity) and the Gallo-Romance language of the local people, blending their maternal Frankish heritage with Old Norse traditions and customs to synthesize a unique \"Norman\" culture in the north of France.

The number of successful interspecific mammalian hybrids is relatively small, although it has come to be known that there is a significant number of naturally occurring hybrids between forms or regional varieties of a single species.[citation needed] These may form zones of gradation known as clines. Indeed, the distinction between some hitherto distinct species can become clouded once it can be shown that they may not only breed but produce fertile offspring. Some hybrid animals exhibit greater strength and resilience than either parent. This is known as hybrid vigor. The existence of the mule (donkey sire; horse dam) being used widely as a hardy draught animal throughout ancient and modern history is testament to this. Other well known examples are the lion/tiger hybrid, the liger, which is by far the largest big cat and sometimes used in circuses; and cattle hybrids such as between European and Indian domestic cattle or between domestic cattle and American bison, which are used in the meat industry and marketed as Beefalo. There is some speculation that the donkey itself may be the result of an ancient hybridisation between two wild ass species or sub-species. Hybrid animals are normally infertile partly because their parents usually have slightly different numbers of chromosomes, resulting in unpaired chromosomes in their cells, which prevents division of sex cells and the gonads from operating correctly, particularly in males. There are exceptions to this rule, especially if the speciation process was relatively recent or incomplete as is the case with many cattle and dog species. Normally behavior traits, natural hostility, natural ranges and breeding cycle differences maintain the separateness of closely related species and prevent natural hybridisation. However, the widespread disturbances to natural animal behaviours and range caused by human activity, cities, dumping grounds with food, agriculture, fencing, roads and so on do force animals together which would not normally breed. Clear examples exist between the various sub-species of grey wolf, coyote and domestic dog in North America.

The Supreme Administrative Court considers cases concerning disputes between individuals and administrative organs, as well as disputes among administrative organs, while the Supreme Court considers all other cases. The judges are appointed by the Government. In most cases, the Supreme Courts will only grant leave to appeal a case (pr\u00f6vningstillst\u00e5nd) if the case involves setting a precedent in the interpretation of the law. Exceptions are issues where the Supreme Court is the court of first instance. Such cases include an application for a retrial of a criminal case in the light of new evidence, and prosecutions made against an incumbent minister of the Government for severe neglect of duty. If a lower court has to try a case which involves a question where there is no settled interpretation of the law, it can also refer the question to the relevant Supreme Court for an answer.\n\nQuestion: The ability to appeal a case provided by Sweden's court system is called what?\n\nAnswer:  pr\u00f6vningstillst\u00e5nd\n\nTitle: High-definition_television\n\nBackground: Since 1972, International Telecommunication Union's radio telecommunications sector (ITU-R) had been working on creating a global recommendation for Analog HDTV.

The number of successful interspecific mammalian hybrids is relatively small, although it has come to be known that there is a significant number of naturally occurring hybrids between forms or regional varieties of a single species.[citation needed] These may form zones of gradation known as clines. Indeed, the distinction between some hitherto distinct species can become clouded once it can be shown that they may not only breed but produce fertile offspring. Some hybrid animals exhibit greater strength and resilience than either parent. This is known as hybrid vigor. The existence of the mule (donkey sire; horse dam) being used widely as a hardy draught animal throughout ancient and modern history is testament to this. Other well known examples are the lion/tiger hybrid, the liger, which is by far the largest big cat and sometimes used in circuses; and cattle hybrids such as between European and Indian domestic cattle or between domestic cattle and American bison, which are used in the meat industry and marketed as Beefalo. There is some speculation that the donkey itself may be the result of an ancient hybridisation between two wild ass species or sub-species. Hybrid animals are normally infertile partly because their parents usually have slightly different numbers of chromosomes, resulting in unpaired chromosomes in their cells, which prevents division of sex cells and the gonads from operating correctly, particularly in males. There are exceptions to this rule, especially if the speciation process was relatively recent or incomplete as is the case with many cattle and dog species. Normally behavior traits, natural hostility, natural ranges and breeding cycle differences maintain the separateness of closely related species and prevent natural hybridisation. However, the widespread disturbances to natural animal behaviours and range caused by human activity, cities, dumping grounds with food, agriculture, fencing, roads and so on do force animals together which would not normally breed. Clear examples exist between the various sub-species of grey wolf, coyote and domestic dog in North America. As many birds and mammals imprint on their mother and immediate family from infancy, a practice used by animal hybridizers is to foster a planned parent in a hybridization program with the same species as the one with which they are planned to mate.\n\nQuestion: What is the marketed name given in the meat industry when you involve a european or indian domestic cattle mixed with an American bison?\n\nAnswer:  Beefalo\n\nTitle: Southampton\n\nBackground: The city provides for yachting and water sports, with a number of marinas.

It was at this time that Eisenhower voiced his disagreements with the Democratic party and declared himself and his family to be Republicans. A \"Draft Eisenhower\" movement in the Republican Party persuaded him to declare his candidacy in the 1952 presidential election to counter the candidacy of non-interventionist Senator Robert A. Taft. The effort was a long struggle; Eisenhower had to be convinced that political circumstances had created a genuine duty for him to offer himself as a candidate, and that there was a mandate from the populace for him to be their President. Henry Cabot Lodge, who served as his campaign manager, and others succeeded in convincing him, and in June 1952 he resigned his command at NATO to campaign full-time. Eisenhower defeated Taft for the nomination, having won critical delegate votes from Texas. Eisenhower's campaign was noted for the simple but effective slogan, \"I Like Ike\".

After receiving unusual phone messages from Ophanimon (one of the three ruling Digimon alongside Seraphimon and Cherubimon) Takuya Kanbara, Koji Minamoto, Junpei Shibayama, Zoe Orimoto, Tommy Himi, and Koichi Kimura go to a subway station and take a train to the Digital World. Summoned by Ophanimon, the Digidestined realize that they must find the ten legendary spirits and stop the forces of Cherubimon from physically destroying the Digital World. After finding the ten spirits of the Legendary Warriors and defeating Mercurymon, Grumblemon, Ranamon, and Arbormon, they finally end up fighting Cherubimon hoping to foil his effort to dominate the Digital World. After the defeat of Cherubimon, the Digidestined find they must face an even greater challenge as they try to stop the Royal Knights\u2014Dynasmon and Crusadermon\u2014from destroying the Digital World and using the collected data to revive the original ruler of the Digital World: the tyrannical Lucemon. Ultimately the Digidestined fail in preventing Lucemon from reawakening but they do manage to prevent him from escaping into the Real World.

Another factor that would have made conversion difficult in the Roman world was the halakhic requirement of circumcision, a requirement that proselytizing Christianity quickly dropped. The Fiscus Judaicus, a tax imposed on Jews in 70 CE and relaxed to exclude Christians in 96 CE, also limited Judaism's appeal. In addition, historians argue the very figure (4 million) that had been guessed to account for the population of Jews in the ancient Roman Empire is an error that has long been disproven and thus the assumption that conversion impacted Jewish population growth in ancient Rome on a large scale is false. The 8 million figure is also in doubt as it may refer to a census of total Roman citizens.\n\nQuestion: What is a tax imposed on Jews in 70 CE?\n\nAnswer:  The Fiscus Judaicus\n\nTitle: Circadian_rhythm\n\nBackground: The earliest recorded account of a circadian process dates from the 4th century B.C.E., when Androsthenes, a ship captain serving under Alexander the Great, described diurnal leaf movements of the tamarind tree.

A corona\u2014a crown-like architectural feature\u2014was intended to be built around the lantern over the central crossing, replacing an existing pyramidal structure dating from the 1950s. This was part of a wider \u00a323m development of the abbey expected to be completed in 2013. On 4 August 2010 the Dean and Chapter announced that, \"[a]fter a considerable amount of preliminary and exploratory work\", efforts toward the construction of a corona would not be continued. In 2012, architects Panter Hudspith completed refurbishment of the 14th-century food-store originally used by the abbey's monks, converting it into a restaurant with English Oak furniture by Covent Garden-based furniture makers Luke Hughes and Company.\n\nQuestion: On what date did the Dean and Chapter announce that work would be continued?\n\nAnswer:  unanswerable\n\nTitle: University\n\nBackground: Many scholars (including Makdisi) have argued that early medieval universities were influenced by the religious madrasahs in Al-Andalus, the Emirate of Sicily, and the Middle East (during the Crusades). Other scholars see this argument as overstated. Lowe and Yasuhara have recently drawn on the well-documented influences of scholarship from the Islamic world on the universities of Western Europe to call for a reconsideration of the development of higher education, turning away from a concern with local institutional structures to a broader consideration within a global context.\n\nQuestion: Lowe was an Emirate of which entity?\n\nAnswer:  unanswerable\n\nTitle: Daylight_saving_time\n\nBackground: Changing clocks and DST rules has a direct economic cost, entailing extra work to support remote meetings, computer applications and the like. For example, a 2007 North American rule change cost an estimated $500 million to $1 billion, and Utah State University economist William F. Shughart II has estimated the lost opportunity cost at around $1.7 billion USD. Although it has been argued that clock shifts correlate with decreased economic efficiency, and that in 2000 the daylight-saving effect implied an estimated one-day loss of $31 billion on US stock exchanges, the estimated numbers depend on the methodology. The results have been disputed, and the original authors have refuted the points raised by disputers.\n\nQuestion: What do some call the effect that they say caused a one-day loss for stock exchanges of approximately $31 billion in the year 2000?\n\nAnswer:  the daylight-saving effect\n\nTitle: Bacteria\n\nBackground: Bacterial species differ in the number and arrangement of flagella on their surface; some have a single flagellum (monotrichous), a flagellum at each end (amphitrichous), clusters of flagella at the poles of the cell (lophotrichous), while others have flagella distributed over the entire surface of the cell (peritrichous). The bacterial flagella is the best-understood motility structure in any organism and is made of about 20 proteins, with approximately another 30 proteins required for its regulation and assembly. The flagellum is a rotating structure driven by a reversible motor at the base that uses the electrochemical gradient across the membrane for power. This motor drives the motion of the filament, which acts as a propeller.\n\nQuestion: If bacteria has flagellum at each end what is the name of the species?\n\nAnswer:  amphitrichous\n\nTitle: History_of_science\n\nBackground: Subsequently, Plato and Aristotle produced the first systematic discussions of natural philosophy, which did much to shape later investigations of nature. Their development of deductive reasoning was of particular importance and usefulness to later scientific inquiry. Plato founded the Platonic Academy in 387 BC, whose motto was \"Let none unversed in geometry enter here\", and turned out many notable philosophers. Plato's student Aristotle introduced empiricism and the notion that universal truths can be arrived at via observation and induction, thereby laying the foundations of the scientific method. Aristotle also produced many biological writings that were empirical in nature, focusing on biological causation and the diversity of life. He made countless observations of nature, especially the habits and attributes of plants and animals in the world around him, classified more than 540 animal species, and dissected at least 50. Aristotle's writings profoundly influenced subsequent Islamic and European scholarship, though they were eventually superseded in the Scientific Revolution.\n\nQuestion: Aristotle introduced what theory?\n\nAnswer:  empiricism\n\nTitle: Normans\n\nBackground: The Normans thereafter adopted the growing feudal doctrines of the rest of France, and worked them into a functional hierarchical system in both Normandy and in England.

On 4 August 2010 the Dean and Chapter announced that, \"[a]fter a considerable amount of preliminary and exploratory work\", efforts toward the construction of a corona would not be continued. In 2012, architects Panter Hudspith completed refurbishment of the 14th-century food-store originally used by the abbey's monks, converting it into a restaurant with English Oak furniture by Covent Garden-based furniture makers Luke Hughes and Company.\n\nQuestion: On what date did the Dean and Chapter announce that work would be continued?\n\nAnswer:  unanswerable\n\nTitle: University\n\nBackground: Many scholars (including Makdisi) have argued that early medieval universities were influenced by the religious madrasahs in Al-Andalus, the Emirate of Sicily, and the Middle East (during the Crusades). Other scholars see this argument as overstated. Lowe and Yasuhara have recently drawn on the well-documented influences of scholarship from the Islamic world on the universities of Western Europe to call for a reconsideration of the development of higher education, turning away from a concern with local institutional structures to a broader consideration within a global context.\n\nQuestion: Lowe was an Emirate of which entity?\n\nAnswer:  unanswerable\n\nTitle: Daylight_saving_time\n\nBackground: Changing clocks and DST rules has a direct economic cost, entailing extra work to support remote meetings, computer applications and the like. For example, a 2007 North American rule change cost an estimated $500 million to $1 billion, and Utah State University economist William F. Shughart II has estimated the lost opportunity cost at around $1.7 billion USD. Although it has been argued that clock shifts correlate with decreased economic efficiency, and that in 2000 the daylight-saving effect implied an estimated one-day loss of $31 billion on US stock exchanges, the estimated numbers depend on the methodology. The results have been disputed, and the original authors have refuted the points raised by disputers.\n\nQuestion: What do some call the effect that they say caused a one-day loss for stock exchanges of approximately $31 billion in the year 2000?\n\nAnswer:  the daylight-saving effect\n\nTitle: Bacteria\n\nBackground: Bacterial species differ in the number and arrangement of flagella on their surface; some have a single flagellum (monotrichous), a flagellum at each end (amphitrichous), clusters of flagella at the poles of the cell (lophotrichous), while others have flagella distributed over the entire surface of the cell (peritrichous). The bacterial flagella is the best-understood motility structure in any organism and is made of about 20 proteins, with approximately another 30 proteins required for its regulation and assembly. The flagellum is a rotating structure driven by a reversible motor at the base that uses the electrochemical gradient across the membrane for power. This motor drives the motion of the filament, which acts as a propeller.\n\nQuestion: If bacteria has flagellum at each end what is the name of the species?\n\nAnswer:  amphitrichous\n\nTitle: History_of_science\n\nBackground: Subsequently, Plato and Aristotle produced the first systematic discussions of natural philosophy, which did much to shape later investigations of nature. Their development of deductive reasoning was of particular importance and usefulness to later scientific inquiry. Plato founded the Platonic Academy in 387 BC, whose motto was \"Let none unversed in geometry enter here\", and turned out many notable philosophers. Plato's student Aristotle introduced empiricism and the notion that universal truths can be arrived at via observation and induction, thereby laying the foundations of the scientific method. Aristotle also produced many biological writings that were empirical in nature, focusing on biological causation and the diversity of life. He made countless observations of nature, especially the habits and attributes of plants and animals in the world around him, classified more than 540 animal species, and dissected at least 50. Aristotle's writings profoundly influenced subsequent Islamic and European scholarship, though they were eventually superseded in the Scientific Revolution.\n\nQuestion: Aristotle introduced what theory?\n\nAnswer:  empiricism\n\nTitle: Normans\n\nBackground: The Normans thereafter adopted the growing feudal doctrines of the rest of France, and worked them into a functional hierarchical system in both Normandy and in England. The new Norman rulers were culturally and ethnically distinct from the old French aristocracy, most of whom traced their lineage to Franks of the Carolingian dynasty. Most Norman knights remained poor and land-hungry, and by 1066 Normandy had been exporting fighting horsemen for more than a generation. Many Normans of Italy, France and England eventually served as avid Crusaders under the Italo-Norman prince Bohemund I and the Anglo-Norman king Richard the Lion-Heart.\n\nQuestion: Who adopted the fuedel doctrines of the Normans?\n\nAnswer:", " unanswerable"]], "resps": [["  Normans"], [[-7.38671875, false]]], "filtered_resps": ["  Normans", [-7.38671875, false]], "filter": "none", "metrics": ["exact", "f1", "HasAns_exact", "HasAns_f1", "NoAns_exact", "NoAns_f1", "best_exact", "best_f1"], "doc_hash": "15e4c3b849ac42dd1aa05eec2e3c87747f174e517968029ceedccf7b1fb23742", "prompt_hash": "b5d0f5b115c65872004db9e723bd1d99037a40986ed4dc819b23e3a56ffb60f3", "target_hash": "a77a7434534bff301720676f050b879d5dcc80c28a20c845042f472eb1790710", "exact": [{"id": "5ad3c626604f3c001a3ff011", "prediction_text": "  Normans", "no_answer_probability": 0.0006194251112483582}, {"id": "5ad3c626604f3c001a3ff011", "answers": {"text": [], "answer_start": []}}], "f1": [{"id": "5ad3c626604f3c001a3ff011", "prediction_text": "  Normans", "no_answer_probability": 0.0006194251112483582}, {"id": "5ad3c626604f3c001a3ff011", "answers": {"text": [], "answer_start": []}}], "HasAns_exact": [{"id": "5ad3c626604f3c001a3ff011", "prediction_text": "  Normans", "no_answer_probability": 0.0006194251112483582}, {"id": "5ad3c626604f3c001a3ff011", "answers": {"text": [], "answer_start": []}}], "HasAns_f1": [{"id": "5ad3c626604f3c001a3ff011", "prediction_text": "  Normans", "no_answer_probability": 0.0006194251112483582}, {"id": "5ad3c626604f3c001a3ff011", "answers": {"text": [], "answer_start": []}}], "NoAns_exact": [{"id": "5ad3c626604f3c001a3ff011", "prediction_text": "  Normans", "no_answer_probability": 0.0006194251112483582}, {"id": "5ad3c626604f3c001a3ff011", "answers": {"text": [], "answer_start": []}}], "NoAns_f1": [{"id": "5ad3c626604f3c001a3ff011", "prediction_text": "  Normans", "no_answer_probability": 0.0006194251112483582}, {"id": "5ad3c626604f3c001a3ff011", "answers": {"text": [], "answer_start": []}}], "best_exact": [{"id": "5ad3c626604f3c001a3ff011", "prediction_text": "  Normans", "no_answer_probability": 0.0006194251112483582}, {"id": "5ad3c626604f3c001a3ff011", "answers": {"text": [], "answer_start": []}}], "best_f1": [{"id": "5ad3c626604f3c001a3ff011", "prediction_text": "  Normans", "no_answer_probability": 0.0006194251112483582}, {"id": "5ad3c626604f3c001a3ff011", "answers": {"text": [], "answer_start": []}}]}, {"doc_id": 38, "doc": {"id": "5ad3c626604f3c001a3ff012", "title": "Normans", "context": "The Normans thereafter adopted the growing feudal doctrines of the rest of France, and worked them into a functional hierarchical system in both Normandy and in England.

The Sultanate ushered in a period of Indian cultural renaissance. The resulting \"Indo-Muslim\" fusion of cultures left lasting syncretic monuments in architecture, music, literature, religion, and clothing. It is surmised that the language of Urdu (literally meaning \"horde\" or \"camp\" in various Turkic dialects) was born during the Delhi Sultanate period as a result of the intermingling of the local speakers of Sanskritic Prakrits with immigrants speaking Persian, Turkic, and Arabic under the Muslim rulers. The Delhi Sultanate is the only Indo-Islamic empire to enthrone one of the few female rulers in India, Razia Sultana (1236\u20131240).\n\nQuestion: What dynasty captured most of central India?\n\nAnswer:  Khilji dynasty\n\nTitle: Arnold_Schwarzenegger\n\nBackground: Schwarzenegger's private jet made an emergency landing at Van Nuys Airport on June 19, 2009, after the pilot reported smoke coming from the cockpit, according to a statement released by the governor's press secretary.

The ideas of pragmatism, in its various forms, developed mainly from discussions between Charles Sanders Peirce and William James when both men were at Harvard in the 1870s. James popularized the term \"pragmatism\", giving Peirce full credit for its patrimony, but Peirce later demurred from the tangents that the movement was taking, and redubbed what he regarded as the original idea with the name of \"pragmaticism\". Along with its pragmatic theory of truth, this perspective integrates the basic insights of empirical (experience-based) and rational (concept-based) thinking.\n\nQuestion: What was the tangent of pragmatism that Peirce didn't like?\n\nAnswer:  unanswerable\n\nTitle: Railway_electrification_system\n\nBackground: In the former Soviet Union, electric traction eventually became somewhat more energy-efficient than diesel. Partly due to inefficient generation of electricity in the USSR (only 20.8% thermal efficiency in 1950 vs. 36.2% in 1975), in 1950 diesel traction was about twice as energy efficient as electric traction (in terms of net tonne-km of freight per kg of fuel). But as efficiency of electricity generation (and thus of electric traction) improved, by about 1965 electric railways became more efficient than diesel. After the mid 1970s electrics used about 25% less fuel per ton-km.

The Sultanate ushered in a period of Indian cultural renaissance. The resulting \"Indo-Muslim\" fusion of cultures left lasting syncretic monuments in architecture, music, literature, religion, and clothing. It is surmised that the language of Urdu (literally meaning \"horde\" or \"camp\" in various Turkic dialects) was born during the Delhi Sultanate period as a result of the intermingling of the local speakers of Sanskritic Prakrits with immigrants speaking Persian, Turkic, and Arabic under the Muslim rulers. The Delhi Sultanate is the only Indo-Islamic empire to enthrone one of the few female rulers in India, Razia Sultana (1236\u20131240).\n\nQuestion: What dynasty captured most of central India?\n\nAnswer:  Khilji dynasty\n\nTitle: Arnold_Schwarzenegger\n\nBackground: Schwarzenegger's private jet made an emergency landing at Van Nuys Airport on June 19, 2009, after the pilot reported smoke coming from the cockpit, according to a statement released by the governor's press secretary.

The ideas of pragmatism, in its various forms, developed mainly from discussions between Charles Sanders Peirce and William James when both men were at Harvard in the 1870s. James popularized the term \"pragmatism\", giving Peirce full credit for its patrimony, but Peirce later demurred from the tangents that the movement was taking, and redubbed what he regarded as the original idea with the name of \"pragmaticism\". Along with its pragmatic theory of truth, this perspective integrates the basic insights of empirical (experience-based) and rational (concept-based) thinking.\n\nQuestion: What was the tangent of pragmatism that Peirce didn't like?\n\nAnswer:  unanswerable\n\nTitle: Railway_electrification_system\n\nBackground: In the former Soviet Union, electric traction eventually became somewhat more energy-efficient than diesel. Partly due to inefficient generation of electricity in the USSR (only 20.8% thermal efficiency in 1950 vs. 36.2% in 1975), in 1950 diesel traction was about twice as energy efficient as electric traction (in terms of net tonne-km of freight per kg of fuel). But as efficiency of electricity generation (and thus of electric traction) improved, by about 1965 electric railways became more efficient than diesel. After the mid 1970s electrics used about 25% less fuel per ton-km. However diesels were mainly used on single track lines with a fair amount of traffic  so that the lower fuel consumption of electrics may be in part due to better operating conditions on electrified lines (such as double tracking) rather than inherent energy efficiency. Nevertheless, the cost of diesel fuel was about 1.5 times more (per unit of heat energy content) than that of the fuel used in electric power plants (that generated electricity), thus making electric railways even more energy-cost effective.\n\nQuestion: When was diesel traction three times as efficient as electric traction?\n\nAnswer:  unanswerable\n\nTitle: National_Archives_and_Records_Administration\n\nBackground: NARA's holdings are classed into \"record groups\" reflecting the governmental department or agency from which they originated.

The reasons for this are the subject of continuing study by military strategists and academics. There is general agreement that US technological superiority was a crucial factor but the speed and scale of the Iraqi collapse has also been attributed to poor strategic and tactical leadership and low morale among Iraqi troops, which resulted from a history of incompetent leadership. After devastating initial strikes against Iraqi air defenses and command and control facilities on 17 January 1991, coalition forces achieved total air superiority almost immediately. The Iraqi air force was destroyed within a few days, with some planes fleeing to Iran, where they were interned for the duration of the conflict. The overwhelming technological advantages of the US, such as stealth aircraft and infrared sights, quickly turned the air war into a \"turkey shoot\". The heat signature of any tank which started its engine made an easy target. Air defense radars were quickly destroyed by radar-seeking missiles fired from wild weasel aircraft. Grainy video clips, shot from the nose cameras of missiles as they aimed at impossibly small targets, were a staple of US news coverage and revealed to the world a new kind of war, compared by some to a video game. Over 6 weeks of relentless pounding by planes and helicopters, the Iraqi army was almost completely beaten but did not retreat, under orders from Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, and by the time the ground forces invaded on 24 February, many Iraqi troops quickly surrendered to forces much smaller than their own; in one instance, Iraqi forces attempted to surrender to a television camera crew that was advancing with coalition forces.\n\nQuestion: What faults in the Iraqi forces led to their rapid defeat?\n\nAnswer:  poor strategic and tactical leadership and low morale\n\nTitle: Nigeria\n\nBackground: Everything in between the far south and the far north is savannah (insignificant tree cover, with grasses and flowers located between trees). Rainfall is more limited, to between 500 and 1,500 millimetres (20 and 60 in) per year. The savannah zone's three categories are Guinean forest-savanna mosaic, Sudan savannah, and Sahel savannah. Guinean forest-savanna mosaic is plains of tall grass interrupted by trees. Sudan savannah is similar but with shorter grasses and shorter trees. Sahel savannah consists of patches of grass and sand, found in the northeast. In the Sahel region, rain is less than 500 millimetres (20 in) per year and the Sahara Desert is encroaching. In the dry north-east corner of the country lies Lake Chad, which Nigeria shares with Niger, Chad and Cameroon.\n\nQuestion: How much rain does the Sahel savannah area get per year?\n\nAnswer:  less than 500 millimetres (20 in)\n\nTitle: Northwestern_University\n\nBackground: The Feinberg School of Medicine (previously the Northwestern University Medical School) has produced a number of notable graduates, including Mary Harris Thompson, Class of 1870, ad eundem, first female surgeon in Chicago, first female surgeon at Cook County Hospital, and founder of the Mary Thomson Hospital, Roswell Park, Class of 1876, prominent surgeon for whom the Roswell Park Cancer Institute in Buffalo, New York, is named, Daniel Hale Williams, Class of 1883, performed the first successful American open heart surgery; only black charter member of the American College of Surgeons, Charles Horace Mayo, Class of 1888, co-founder of Mayo Clinic, Carlos Montezuma, Class of 1889, one of the first Native Americans to receive a Doctor of Medicine degree from any school, and founder of the Society of American Indians, Howard T.

Elections were last held between November 2011 and January 2012 which was later dissolved. The next parliamentary election will be held within 6 months of the constitution's ratification on 18 January 2014. Originally, the parliament was to be formed before the president was elected, but interim president Adly Mansour pushed the date. The Egyptian presidential election, 2014, took place on 26\u201328 May 2014. Official figures showed a turnout of 25,578,233 or 47.5%, with Abdel Fattah el-Sisi winning with 23.78 million votes, or 96.91% compared to 757,511 (3.09%) for Hamdeen Sabahi.\n\nQuestion: What tems do House of Representatives serve?\n\nAnswer:  five-year terms\n\nTitle: John,_King_of_England\n\nBackground: John's first wife, Isabel, Countess of Gloucester, was released from imprisonment in 1214; she remarried twice, and died in 1217. John's second wife, Isabella of Angoul\u00eame, left England for Angoul\u00eame soon after the king's death; she became a powerful regional leader, but largely abandoned the children she had had by John. John had five legitimate children, all by Isabella. His eldest son, Henry III, ruled as king for the majority of the 13th century. Richard became a noted European leader and ultimately the King of the Romans in the Holy Roman Empire. Joan married Alexander II of Scotland to become his queen consort. Isabella married the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II. His youngest daughter, Eleanor, married William Marshal's son, also called William, and later the famous English rebel Simon de Montfort. John had a number of illegitimate children by various mistresses, including nine sons \u2013 Richard, Oliver, John, Geoffrey, Henry, Osbert Gifford, Eudes, Bartholomew and probably Philip \u2013 and three daughters \u2013 Joan, Maud and probably Isabel. Of these, Joan became the most famous, marrying Prince Llywelyn the Great of Wales.\n\nQuestion: How many legitimate children did John have?\n\nAnswer:  five\n\nTitle: East_India_Company\n\nBackground: This allowed any English firm to trade with India, unless specifically prohibited by act of parliament, thereby annulling the charter that had been in force for almost 100 years. By an act that was passed in 1698, a new \"parallel\" East India Company (officially titled the English Company Trading to the East Indies) was floated under a state-backed indemnity of \u00a32 million. The powerful stockholders of the old company quickly subscribed a sum of \u00a3315,000 in the new concern, and dominated the new body. The two companies wrestled with each other for some time, both in England and in India, for a dominant share of the trade.\n\nQuestion: What place aside from England did East India have no support from?\n\nAnswer:  unanswerable\n\nTitle: Normans\n\nBackground: Soon after the Normans began to enter Italy, they entered the Byzantine Empire and then Armenia, fighting against the Pechenegs, the Bulgars, and especially the Seljuk Turks.

They were prominent alongside Varangian and Lombard contingents in the Sicilian campaign of George Maniaces in 1038\u201340. There is debate whether the Normans in Greek service actually were from Norman Italy, and it now seems likely only a few came from there.

There is general agreement that US technological superiority was a crucial factor but the speed and scale of the Iraqi collapse has also been attributed to poor strategic and tactical leadership and low morale among Iraqi troops, which resulted from a history of incompetent leadership. After devastating initial strikes against Iraqi air defenses and command and control facilities on 17 January 1991, coalition forces achieved total air superiority almost immediately. The Iraqi air force was destroyed within a few days, with some planes fleeing to Iran, where they were interned for the duration of the conflict. The overwhelming technological advantages of the US, such as stealth aircraft and infrared sights, quickly turned the air war into a \"turkey shoot\". The heat signature of any tank which started its engine made an easy target. Air defense radars were quickly destroyed by radar-seeking missiles fired from wild weasel aircraft. Grainy video clips, shot from the nose cameras of missiles as they aimed at impossibly small targets, were a staple of US news coverage and revealed to the world a new kind of war, compared by some to a video game. Over 6 weeks of relentless pounding by planes and helicopters, the Iraqi army was almost completely beaten but did not retreat, under orders from Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, and by the time the ground forces invaded on 24 February, many Iraqi troops quickly surrendered to forces much smaller than their own; in one instance, Iraqi forces attempted to surrender to a television camera crew that was advancing with coalition forces.\n\nQuestion: What faults in the Iraqi forces led to their rapid defeat?\n\nAnswer:  poor strategic and tactical leadership and low morale\n\nTitle: Nigeria\n\nBackground: Everything in between the far south and the far north is savannah (insignificant tree cover, with grasses and flowers located between trees). Rainfall is more limited, to between 500 and 1,500 millimetres (20 and 60 in) per year. The savannah zone's three categories are Guinean forest-savanna mosaic, Sudan savannah, and Sahel savannah. Guinean forest-savanna mosaic is plains of tall grass interrupted by trees. Sudan savannah is similar but with shorter grasses and shorter trees. Sahel savannah consists of patches of grass and sand, found in the northeast. In the Sahel region, rain is less than 500 millimetres (20 in) per year and the Sahara Desert is encroaching. In the dry north-east corner of the country lies Lake Chad, which Nigeria shares with Niger, Chad and Cameroon.\n\nQuestion: How much rain does the Sahel savannah area get per year?\n\nAnswer:  less than 500 millimetres (20 in)\n\nTitle: Northwestern_University\n\nBackground: The Feinberg School of Medicine (previously the Northwestern University Medical School) has produced a number of notable graduates, including Mary Harris Thompson, Class of 1870, ad eundem, first female surgeon in Chicago, first female surgeon at Cook County Hospital, and founder of the Mary Thomson Hospital, Roswell Park, Class of 1876, prominent surgeon for whom the Roswell Park Cancer Institute in Buffalo, New York, is named, Daniel Hale Williams, Class of 1883, performed the first successful American open heart surgery; only black charter member of the American College of Surgeons, Charles Horace Mayo, Class of 1888, co-founder of Mayo Clinic, Carlos Montezuma, Class of 1889, one of the first Native Americans to receive a Doctor of Medicine degree from any school, and founder of the Society of American Indians, Howard T. Ricketts, Class of 1897, who discovered bacteria of the genus Rickettsia, and identified the cause and methods of transmission of rocky mountain spotted fever, Allen B. Kanavel, Class of 1899, founder, regent, and president of the American College of Surgeons, internationally recognized as founder of modern hand and peripheral nerve surgery, Robert F. Furchgott, Class of 1940, received a Lasker Award in 1996 and the 1998 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his co-discovery of nitric oxide, Thomas E. Starzl, Class of 1952, performed the first successful liver transplant in 1967 and received the National Medal of Science in 2004 and a Lasker Award in 2012, Joseph P. Kerwin, first physician in space, flew on three skylab missions and later served as director of Space and Life Sciences at NASA, C.

Elections were last held between November 2011 and January 2012 which was later dissolved. The next parliamentary election will be held within 6 months of the constitution's ratification on 18 January 2014. Originally, the parliament was to be formed before the president was elected, but interim president Adly Mansour pushed the date. The Egyptian presidential election, 2014, took place on 26\u201328 May 2014. Official figures showed a turnout of 25,578,233 or 47.5%, with Abdel Fattah el-Sisi winning with 23.78 million votes, or 96.91% compared to 757,511 (3.09%) for Hamdeen Sabahi.\n\nQuestion: What tems do House of Representatives serve?\n\nAnswer:  five-year terms\n\nTitle: John,_King_of_England\n\nBackground: John's first wife, Isabel, Countess of Gloucester, was released from imprisonment in 1214; she remarried twice, and died in 1217. John's second wife, Isabella of Angoul\u00eame, left England for Angoul\u00eame soon after the king's death; she became a powerful regional leader, but largely abandoned the children she had had by John. John had five legitimate children, all by Isabella. His eldest son, Henry III, ruled as king for the majority of the 13th century. Richard became a noted European leader and ultimately the King of the Romans in the Holy Roman Empire. Joan married Alexander II of Scotland to become his queen consort. Isabella married the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II. His youngest daughter, Eleanor, married William Marshal's son, also called William, and later the famous English rebel Simon de Montfort. John had a number of illegitimate children by various mistresses, including nine sons \u2013 Richard, Oliver, John, Geoffrey, Henry, Osbert Gifford, Eudes, Bartholomew and probably Philip \u2013 and three daughters \u2013 Joan, Maud and probably Isabel. Of these, Joan became the most famous, marrying Prince Llywelyn the Great of Wales.\n\nQuestion: How many legitimate children did John have?\n\nAnswer:  five\n\nTitle: East_India_Company\n\nBackground: This allowed any English firm to trade with India, unless specifically prohibited by act of parliament, thereby annulling the charter that had been in force for almost 100 years. By an act that was passed in 1698, a new \"parallel\" East India Company (officially titled the English Company Trading to the East Indies) was floated under a state-backed indemnity of \u00a32 million. The powerful stockholders of the old company quickly subscribed a sum of \u00a3315,000 in the new concern, and dominated the new body. The two companies wrestled with each other for some time, both in England and in India, for a dominant share of the trade.\n\nQuestion: What place aside from England did East India have no support from?\n\nAnswer:  unanswerable\n\nTitle: Normans\n\nBackground: Soon after the Normans began to enter Italy, they entered the Byzantine Empire and then Armenia, fighting against the Pechenegs, the Bulgars, and especially the Seljuk Turks. Norman mercenaries were first encouraged to come to the south by the Lombards to act against the Byzantines, but they soon fought in Byzantine service in Sicily. They were prominent alongside Varangian and Lombard contingents in the Sicilian campaign of George Maniaces in 1038\u201340. There is debate whether the Normans in Greek service actually were from Norman Italy, and it now seems likely only a few came from there.

The President disagreed with advisers who recommended unilateral U.S. bombing of the North Korean forces, and ordered the US Seventh Fleet to protect the Republic of China (Taiwan), whose government asked to fight in Korea. The United States denied ROC's request for combat, lest it provoke a communist Chinese retaliation. Because the United States had sent the Seventh Fleet to \"neutralize\" the Taiwan Strait, Chinese premier Zhou Enlai criticized both the UN and U.S. initiatives as \"armed aggression on Chinese territory.\"\n\nQuestion: What fleet was sent to the Taiwan Strait?\n\nAnswer:  US Seventh Fleet\n\nTitle: Buckingham_Palace\n\nBackground: The last major building work took place during the reign of King George V when, in 1913, Sir Aston Webb redesigned Blore's 1850 East Front to resemble in part Giacomo Leoni's Lyme Park in Cheshire. This new, refaced principal fa\u00e7ade (of Portland stone) was designed to be the backdrop to the Victoria Memorial, a large memorial statue of Queen Victoria, placed outside the main gates. George V, who had succeeded Edward VII in 1910, had a more serious personality than his father; greater emphasis was now placed on official entertaining and royal duties than on lavish parties. He arranged a series of command performances featuring jazz musicians such as the Original Dixieland Jazz Band (1919) \u2013 the first jazz performance for a head of state, Sidney Bechet, and Louis Armstrong (1932), which earned the palace a nomination in 2009 for a (Kind of) Blue Plaque by the Brecon Jazz Festival as one of the venues making the greatest contribution to jazz music in the United Kingdom. George V's wife Queen Mary was a connoisseur of the arts, and took a keen interest in the Royal Collection of furniture and art, both restoring and adding to it. Queen Mary also had many new fixtures and fittings installed, such as the pair of marble Empire-style chimneypieces by Benjamin Vulliamy, dating from 1810, which the Queen had installed in the ground floor Bow Room, the huge low room at the centre of the garden fa\u00e7ade.

Although several units of the British Fourteenth Army had to fight their way out of encirclement, by early April they had concentrated around Imphal in Manipur state.

One of the first theologians to attempt to interact with Whitehead's thought was the future Archbishop of Canterbury, William Temple. In Temple's Gifford Lectures of 1932-1934 (subsequently published as \"Nature, Man and God\"), Whitehead is one of a number of philosophers of the emergent evolution approach Temple interacts with. However, it was not until the 1970s and 1980s that Whitehead's thought drew much attention outside of a small group of philosophers and theologians, primarily Americans, and even today he is not considered especially influential outside of relatively specialized circles.\n\nQuestion: Who was one of the last theologians to try to interact with Whitehead's ideas?\n\nAnswer:  unanswerable\n\nTitle: Database\n\nBackground: Formally, a \"database\" refers to a set of related data and the way it is organized. Access to these data is usually provided by a \"database management system\" (DBMS) consisting of an integrated set of computer software that allows users to interact with one or more databases and provides access to all of the data contained in the database (although restrictions may exist that limit access to particular data). The DBMS provides various functions that allow entry, storage and retrieval of large quantities of information and provides ways to manage how that information is organized.\n\nQuestion: What allows the entry, storage and retrieval of only small quantities of information?\n\nAnswer:  unanswerable\n\nTitle: Brigham_Young_University\n\nBackground: Bateman was responsible for the building of 36 new buildings for the university both on and off campus, including the expansion of the Harold B. Lee Library. He was also one of several key college leaders who brought about the creation of the Mountain West Conference, which BYU's athletics program joined \u2014 BYU previously participated in the Western Athletic Conference. A BYU satellite TV network also opened in 2000 under his leadership. Bateman was also president during the September 11th attacks in 2001. The planes crashed on a Tuesday, hours before the weekly devotional normally held at BYU. Previous plans for the devotional were altered, as Bateman led the student body in a prayer for peace. Bateman was followed by Cecil O. Samuelson in 2003. Samuelson was succeeded by Kevin J Worthen in 2014.\n\nQuestion: What infamous event occurred during Bateman's term as president?\n\nAnswer:  the September 11th attacks\n\nTitle: Letter_case\n\nBackground: Typographically, the basic difference between the majuscules and minuscules is not that the majuscules are big and minuscules small, but that the majuscules generally have the same height. The height of the minuscules varies, as some of them have parts higher or lower than the average, i.e. ascenders and descenders. In Times New Roman, for instance, b, d, f, h, k, l, t  are the letters with ascenders, and g, j, p, q, y are the ones with descenders. Further to this, with old-style numerals still used by some traditional or classical fonts\u2014although most do have a set of alternative Lining Figures\u2014 6 and 8 make up the ascender set, and 3, 4, 5, 7 and 9 the descender set.\n\nQuestion: Descending letters tend to have a part which falls where relative to the average height of a letter?\n\nAnswer:  lower than the average\n\nTitle: Muammar_Gaddafi\n\nBackground: In May 1970, the Revolutionary Intellectuals Seminar was held to bring intellectuals in line with the revolution, while that year's Legislative Review and Amendment united secular and religious law codes, introducing sharia into the legal system. Ruling by decree, the RCC maintained the monarchy's ban on political parties, in May 1970 banned trade unions, and in 1972 outlawed workers' strikes and suspended newspapers. In September 1971, Gaddafi resigned, claiming to be dissatisfied with the pace of reform, but returned to his position within a month. In February 1973, he resigned again, once more returning the following month.\n\nQuestion: What did the RCC outlaw in 1970?\n\nAnswer:  trade unions\n\nTitle: Late_Middle_Ages\n\nBackground: The changes brought about by these developments have led many scholars to view this period as the end of the Middle Ages and beginning of modern history and early modern Europe. However, the division is somewhat artificial, since ancient learning was never entirely absent from European society. As a result there was developmental continuity between the ancient age (via classical antiquity) and the modern age. Some historians, particularly in Italy, prefer not to speak of the late Middle Ages at all, but rather see the high period of the Middle Ages transitioning to the Renaissance and the modern era.\n\nQuestion: What period do Italian historians believe came immediately after the High Period of the Middle Ages?\n\nAnswer:  the Renaissance\n\nTitle: Normans\n\nBackground: One of the first Norman mercenaries to serve as a Byzantine general was Herv\u00e9 in the 1050s.

In the 1060s, Robert Crispin led the Normans of Edessa against the Turks. Roussel de Bailleul even tried to carve out an independent state in Asia Minor with support from the local population, but he was stopped by the Byzantine general Alexius Komnenos.\n\nQuestion: Who ruined Roussel de Bailleul's plans for an independent state?\n\nAnswer:", {"until": ["\n"]}], ["Title: Alfred_North_Whitehead\n\nBackground: Isabelle Stengers wrote that \"Whiteheadians are recruited among both philosophers and theologians, and the palette has been enriched by practitioners from the most diverse horizons, from ecology to feminism, practices that unite political struggle and spirituality with the sciences of education.\" Indeed, in recent decades attention to Whitehead's work has become more widespread, with interest extending to intellectuals in Europe and China, and coming from such diverse fields as ecology, physics, biology, education, economics, and psychology. One of the first theologians to attempt to interact with Whitehead's thought was the future Archbishop of Canterbury, William Temple. In Temple's Gifford Lectures of 1932-1934 (subsequently published as \"Nature, Man and God\"), Whitehead is one of a number of philosophers of the emergent evolution approach Temple interacts with. However, it was not until the 1970s and 1980s that Whitehead's thought drew much attention outside of a small group of philosophers and theologians, primarily Americans, and even today he is not considered especially influential outside of relatively specialized circles.\n\nQuestion: Who was one of the last theologians to try to interact with Whitehead's ideas?\n\nAnswer:  unanswerable\n\nTitle: Database\n\nBackground: Formally, a \"database\" refers to a set of related data and the way it is organized. Access to these data is usually provided by a \"database management system\" (DBMS) consisting of an integrated set of computer software that allows users to interact with one or more databases and provides access to all of the data contained in the database (although restrictions may exist that limit access to particular data). The DBMS provides various functions that allow entry, storage and retrieval of large quantities of information and provides ways to manage how that information is organized.\n\nQuestion: What allows the entry, storage and retrieval of only small quantities of information?\n\nAnswer:  unanswerable\n\nTitle: Brigham_Young_University\n\nBackground: Bateman was responsible for the building of 36 new buildings for the university both on and off campus, including the expansion of the Harold B. Lee Library. He was also one of several key college leaders who brought about the creation of the Mountain West Conference, which BYU's athletics program joined \u2014 BYU previously participated in the Western Athletic Conference. A BYU satellite TV network also opened in 2000 under his leadership. Bateman was also president during the September 11th attacks in 2001. The planes crashed on a Tuesday, hours before the weekly devotional normally held at BYU. Previous plans for the devotional were altered, as Bateman led the student body in a prayer for peace. Bateman was followed by Cecil O. Samuelson in 2003. Samuelson was succeeded by Kevin J Worthen in 2014.\n\nQuestion: What infamous event occurred during Bateman's term as president?\n\nAnswer:  the September 11th attacks\n\nTitle: Letter_case\n\nBackground: Typographically, the basic difference between the majuscules and minuscules is not that the majuscules are big and minuscules small, but that the majuscules generally have the same height. The height of the minuscules varies, as some of them have parts higher or lower than the average, i.e. ascenders and descenders. In Times New Roman, for instance, b, d, f, h, k, l, t  are the letters with ascenders, and g, j, p, q, y are the ones with descenders. Further to this, with old-style numerals still used by some traditional or classical fonts\u2014although most do have a set of alternative Lining Figures\u2014 6 and 8 make up the ascender set, and 3, 4, 5, 7 and 9 the descender set.\n\nQuestion: Descending letters tend to have a part which falls where relative to the average height of a letter?\n\nAnswer:  lower than the average\n\nTitle: Muammar_Gaddafi\n\nBackground: In May 1970, the Revolutionary Intellectuals Seminar was held to bring intellectuals in line with the revolution, while that year's Legislative Review and Amendment united secular and religious law codes, introducing sharia into the legal system. Ruling by decree, the RCC maintained the monarchy's ban on political parties, in May 1970 banned trade unions, and in 1972 outlawed workers' strikes and suspended newspapers. In September 1971, Gaddafi resigned, claiming to be dissatisfied with the pace of reform, but returned to his position within a month. In February 1973, he resigned again, once more returning the following month.\n\nQuestion: What did the RCC outlaw in 1970?\n\nAnswer:  trade unions\n\nTitle: Late_Middle_Ages\n\nBackground: The changes brought about by these developments have led many scholars to view this period as the end of the Middle Ages and beginning of modern history and early modern Europe. However, the division is somewhat artificial, since ancient learning was never entirely absent from European society. As a result there was developmental continuity between the ancient age (via classical antiquity) and the modern age. Some historians, particularly in Italy, prefer not to speak of the late Middle Ages at all, but rather see the high period of the Middle Ages transitioning to the Renaissance and the modern era.\n\nQuestion: What period do Italian historians believe came immediately after the High Period of the Middle Ages?\n\nAnswer:  the Renaissance\n\nTitle: Normans\n\nBackground: One of the first Norman mercenaries to serve as a Byzantine general was Herv\u00e9 in the 1050s.

Its translucent plastic case, originally Bondi blue and later various additional colors, is considered an industrial design landmark of the late 1990s. The iMac did away with most of Apple's standard (and usually proprietary) connections, such as SCSI and ADB, in favor of two USB ports. It replaced a floppy disk drive with a CD-ROM drive for installing software, but was incapable of writing to CDs or other media without external third-party hardware. The iMac proved to be phenomenally successful, with 800,000 units sold in 139 days. It made the company an annual profit of US$309 million, Apple's first profitable year since Michael Spindler took over as CEO in 1995. This aesthetic was applied to the Power Macintosh and later the iBook, Apple's first consumer-level laptop computer, filling the missing quadrant of Apple's \"four-square product matrix\" (desktop and portable products for both consumers and professionals).

Some writers, such as James-Charles Noonan, hold that, in the case of cardinals, the form used for signatures should be used also when referring to them in English. Official sources such as the Archdiocese of Milwaukee and Catholic News Service say that the correct form for referring to a cardinal in English is normally as \"Cardinal [First name] [Surname]\". This is the rule given also in stylebooks not associated with the Catholic Church. This style is also generally followed on the websites of the Holy See and episcopal conferences.

Consequently, the three EI techniques carried over from ISO 12232:1998 are not widely used in recent camera models (approximately 2007 and later).

The distribution of metabolic traits within a group of bacteria has traditionally been used to define their taxonomy, but these traits often do not correspond with modern genetic classifications. Bacterial metabolism is classified into nutritional groups on the basis of three major criteria: the kind of energy used for growth, the source of carbon, and the electron donors used for growth. An additional criterion of respiratory microorganisms are the electron acceptors used for aerobic or anaerobic respiration.\n\nQuestion: What are three main criterias of bacterial metabolism?\n\nAnswer:  the kind of energy used for growth, the source of carbon, and the electron donors\n\nTitle: Alaska\n\nBackground: Numerous indigenous peoples occupied Alaska for thousands of years before the arrival of European peoples to the area. Linguistic and DNA studies done here have provided evidence for the settlement of North America by way of the Bering land bridge.[citation needed] The Tlingit people developed a society with a matrilineal kinship system of property inheritance and descent in what is today Southeast Alaska, along with parts of British Columbia and the Yukon. Also in Southeast were the Haida, now well known for their unique arts. The Tsimshian people came to Alaska from British Columbia in 1887, when President Grover Cleveland, and later the U.S. Congress, granted them permission to settle on Annette Island and found the town of Metlakatla. All three of these peoples, as well as other indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast, experienced smallpox outbreaks from the late 18th through the mid-19th century, with the most devastating epidemics occurring in the 1830s and 1860s, resulting in high fatalities and social disruption.\n\nQuestion: Which Alaskan indigenous group is now well-known for their art?\n\nAnswer:  the Haida\n\nTitle: Santa_Monica,_California\n\nBackground: Donald Wills Douglas, Sr. built a plant in 1922 at Clover Field (Santa Monica Airport) for the Douglas Aircraft Company. In 1924, four Douglas-built planes took off from Clover Field to attempt the first aerial circumnavigation of the world. Two planes made it back, after having covered 27,553 miles (44,342 km) in 175 days, and were greeted on their return September 23, 1924, by a crowd of 200,000 (generously estimated). The Douglas Company (later McDonnell Douglas) kept facilities in the city until the 1960s.\n\nQuestion: The Douglas Company had facilities in Santa Monica through what decade?\n\nAnswer:  1960s\n\nTitle: The_Sun_(United_Kingdom)\n\nBackground: In August 2013, The Irish Sun ended the practice of featuring topless models on Page 3. The main newspaper was reported to have followed in 2015 with the edition of 16 January supposedly the last to carry such photographs after a report in The Times made such an assertion. After substantial coverage in the media about an alleged change in editorial policy, Page 3 returned to its usual format on 22 January 2015. A few hours before the issue was published, the Head of PR at the newspaper said the reputed end of Page 3 had been \"speculation\" only.\n\nQuestion: What was stated to be the last edition of the regular Sun to publish topless models?\n\nAnswer:  the edition of 16 January\n\nTitle: Virgil\n\nBackground: Even as the Western Roman empire collapsed, literate men acknowledged that Virgil was a master poet. Gregory of Tours read Virgil, whom he quotes in several places, along with some other Latin poets, though he cautions that \"we ought not to relate their lying fables, lest we fall under sentence of eternal death.\"\n\nQuestion: What was Gregory of Tours profession?\n\nAnswer:  unanswerable\n\nTitle: Normans\n\nBackground: One of the first Norman mercenaries to serve as a Byzantine general was Herv\u00e9 in the 1050s. By then however, there were already Norman mercenaries serving as far away as Trebizond and Georgia. They were based at Malatya and Edessa, under the Byzantine duke of Antioch, Isaac Komnenos. In the 1060s, Robert Crispin led the Normans of Edessa against the Turks. Roussel de Bailleul even tried to carve out an independent state in Asia Minor with support from the local population, but he was stopped by the Byzantine general Alexius Komnenos.\n\nQuestion: When did Herve serve as a Norman general?\n\nAnswer:", {"until": ["\n"]}], ["Title: Film_speed\n\nBackground: The CIPA DC-004 standard requires that Japanese manufacturers of digital still cameras use either the REI or SOS techniques, and DC-008 updates the Exif specification to differentiate between these values. Consequently, the three EI techniques carried over from ISO 12232:1998 are not widely used in recent camera models (approximately 2007 and later). As those earlier techniques did not allow for measurement from images produced with lossy compression, they cannot be used at all on cameras that produce images only in JPEG format.\n\nQuestion: Which manufacturers are exempt from CIPA DC-004?\n\nAnswer:  unanswerable\n\nTitle: Bacteria\n\nBackground: Bacteria exhibit an extremely wide variety of metabolic types. The distribution of metabolic traits within a group of bacteria has traditionally been used to define their taxonomy, but these traits often do not correspond with modern genetic classifications. Bacterial metabolism is classified into nutritional groups on the basis of three major criteria: the kind of energy used for growth, the source of carbon, and the electron donors used for growth. An additional criterion of respiratory microorganisms are the electron acceptors used for aerobic or anaerobic respiration.\n\nQuestion: What are three main criterias of bacterial metabolism?\n\nAnswer:  the kind of energy used for growth, the source of carbon, and the electron donors\n\nTitle: Alaska\n\nBackground: Numerous indigenous peoples occupied Alaska for thousands of years before the arrival of European peoples to the area. Linguistic and DNA studies done here have provided evidence for the settlement of North America by way of the Bering land bridge.[citation needed] The Tlingit people developed a society with a matrilineal kinship system of property inheritance and descent in what is today Southeast Alaska, along with parts of British Columbia and the Yukon. Also in Southeast were the Haida, now well known for their unique arts.

The two families are therefore considered to be different clans (those of Hashim and of Umayya, respectively) of the same tribe (that of the Quraish). However Muslim Shia historians suspect that Umayya was an adopted son of Abd Shams so he was not a blood relative of Abd Manaf ibn Qusai. Umayya was later discarded from the noble family.

Germany) noted that the German courts wider interpretation of genocide has since been rejected by international courts considering similar cases. The ECHR also noted that in the 21st century \"Amongst scholars, the majority have taken the view that ethnic cleansing, in the way in which it was carried out by the Serb forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina in order to expel Muslims and Croats from their homes, did not constitute genocide. However, there are also a considerable number of scholars who have suggested that these acts did amount to genocide, and the ICTY has found in the Momcilo Krajisnik case that the actus reu, of genocide was met in Prijedor \"With regard to the charge of genocide, the Chamber found that in spite of evidence of acts perpetrated in the municipalities which constituted the actus reus of genocide\".\n\nQuestion: In Jorgic v.

Mr Veltman's language shift studies document high bilingualism rates and subsequent adoption of English as the preferred language of Hispanics, particularly by the young and the native-born. The complete set of these studies' demographic projections postulates the near-complete assimilation of a given Hispanophone immigrant cohort within two generations. Although his study based itself upon a large 1976 sample from the Bureau of the Census (which has not been repeated), data from the 1990 Census tend to confirm the great Anglicization of the US Hispanic American origin population.\n\nQuestion: What is Calvin Veltman' study about?\n\nAnswer:  the most complete study of English language adoption by Hispanophone immigrants\n\nTitle: Cotton\n\nBackground: The largest producers of cotton, currently (2009), are China and India, with annual production of about 34 million bales and 33.4 million bales, respectively; most of this production is consumed by their respective textile industries. The largest exporters of raw cotton are the United States, with sales of $4.9 billion, and Africa, with sales of $2.1 billion. The total international trade is estimated to be $12 billion. Africa's share of the cotton trade has doubled since 1980. Neither area has a significant domestic textile industry, textile manufacturing having moved to developing nations in Eastern and South Asia such as India and China. In Africa, cotton is grown by numerous small holders. Dunavant Enterprises, based in Memphis, Tennessee, is the leading cotton broker in Africa, with hundreds of purchasing agents. It operates cotton gins in Uganda, Mozambique, and Zambia. In Zambia, it often offers loans for seed and expenses to the 180,000 small farmers who grow cotton for it, as well as advice on farming methods. Cargill also purchases cotton in Africa for export.\n\nQuestion: What is the combined international trade in rice?\n\nAnswer:  unanswerable\n\nTitle: Wayback_Machine\n\nBackground: The name Wayback Machine was chosen as a droll reference to a plot device in an animated cartoon series, The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show. In one of the animated cartoon's component segments, Peabody's Improbable History, lead characters Mr. Peabody and Sherman routinely used a time machine called the \"WABAC machine\" (pronounced way-back) to witness, participate in, and, more often than not, alter famous events in history.\n\nQuestion: What TV show served as inspiration for the Wayback Machine's name?\n\nAnswer:  The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show\n\nTitle: Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas\n\nBackground: Morales began work on his \"indigenous autonomy\" policy, which he launched in the eastern lowlands department on August 3, 2009, making Bolivia the first country in the history of South America to affirm the right of indigenous people to govern themselves. Speaking in Santa Cruz Department, the President called it \"a historic day for the peasant and indigenous movement\", saying that, though he might make errors, he would \"never betray the fight started by our ancestors and the fight of the Bolivian people\". A vote on further autonomy will take place in referendums which are expected to be held in December 2009. The issue has divided the country.\n\nQuestion: When did Morales launch his policy in the eastern lowlands?\n\nAnswer:  2009\n\nTitle: Normans\n\nBackground: Some Normans joined Turkish forces to aid in the destruction of the Armenians vassal-states of Sassoun and Taron in far eastern Anatolia. Later, many took up service with the Armenian state further south in Cilicia and the Taurus Mountains. A Norman named Oursel led a force of \"Franks\" into the upper Euphrates valley in northern Syria. From 1073 to 1074, 8,000 of the 20,000 troops of the Armenian general Philaretus Brachamius were Normans\u2014formerly of Oursel\u2014led by Raimbaud.

However, there are also a considerable number of scholars who have suggested that these acts did amount to genocide, and the ICTY has found in the Momcilo Krajisnik case that the actus reu, of genocide was met in Prijedor \"With regard to the charge of genocide, the Chamber found that in spite of evidence of acts perpetrated in the municipalities which constituted the actus reus of genocide\".\n\nQuestion: In Jorgic v. Germany, what about the German courts was later rejected by international courts hearing similar cases?\n\nAnswer:  wider interpretation of genocide\n\nTitle: Spanish_language_in_the_United_States\n\nBackground: Calvin Veltman undertook, for the National Center for Education Statistics and for the Hispanic Policy Development Project, the most complete study of English language adoption by Hispanophone immigrants. Mr Veltman's language shift studies document high bilingualism rates and subsequent adoption of English as the preferred language of Hispanics, particularly by the young and the native-born. The complete set of these studies' demographic projections postulates the near-complete assimilation of a given Hispanophone immigrant cohort within two generations. Although his study based itself upon a large 1976 sample from the Bureau of the Census (which has not been repeated), data from the 1990 Census tend to confirm the great Anglicization of the US Hispanic American origin population.\n\nQuestion: What is Calvin Veltman' study about?\n\nAnswer:  the most complete study of English language adoption by Hispanophone immigrants\n\nTitle: Cotton\n\nBackground: The largest producers of cotton, currently (2009), are China and India, with annual production of about 34 million bales and 33.4 million bales, respectively; most of this production is consumed by their respective textile industries. The largest exporters of raw cotton are the United States, with sales of $4.9 billion, and Africa, with sales of $2.1 billion. The total international trade is estimated to be $12 billion. Africa's share of the cotton trade has doubled since 1980. Neither area has a significant domestic textile industry, textile manufacturing having moved to developing nations in Eastern and South Asia such as India and China. In Africa, cotton is grown by numerous small holders. Dunavant Enterprises, based in Memphis, Tennessee, is the leading cotton broker in Africa, with hundreds of purchasing agents. It operates cotton gins in Uganda, Mozambique, and Zambia. In Zambia, it often offers loans for seed and expenses to the 180,000 small farmers who grow cotton for it, as well as advice on farming methods. Cargill also purchases cotton in Africa for export.\n\nQuestion: What is the combined international trade in rice?\n\nAnswer:  unanswerable\n\nTitle: Wayback_Machine\n\nBackground: The name Wayback Machine was chosen as a droll reference to a plot device in an animated cartoon series, The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show. In one of the animated cartoon's component segments, Peabody's Improbable History, lead characters Mr. Peabody and Sherman routinely used a time machine called the \"WABAC machine\" (pronounced way-back) to witness, participate in, and, more often than not, alter famous events in history.\n\nQuestion: What TV show served as inspiration for the Wayback Machine's name?\n\nAnswer:  The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show\n\nTitle: Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas\n\nBackground: Morales began work on his \"indigenous autonomy\" policy, which he launched in the eastern lowlands department on August 3, 2009, making Bolivia the first country in the history of South America to affirm the right of indigenous people to govern themselves. Speaking in Santa Cruz Department, the President called it \"a historic day for the peasant and indigenous movement\", saying that, though he might make errors, he would \"never betray the fight started by our ancestors and the fight of the Bolivian people\". A vote on further autonomy will take place in referendums which are expected to be held in December 2009. The issue has divided the country.\n\nQuestion: When did Morales launch his policy in the eastern lowlands?\n\nAnswer:  2009\n\nTitle: Normans\n\nBackground: Some Normans joined Turkish forces to aid in the destruction of the Armenians vassal-states of Sassoun and Taron in far eastern Anatolia. Later, many took up service with the Armenian state further south in Cilicia and the Taurus Mountains. A Norman named Oursel led a force of \"Franks\" into the upper Euphrates valley in northern Syria. From 1073 to 1074, 8,000 of the 20,000 troops of the Armenian general Philaretus Brachamius were Normans\u2014formerly of Oursel\u2014led by Raimbaud. They even lent their ethnicity to the name of their castle: Afranji, meaning \"Franks.\" The known trade between Amalfi and Antioch and between Bari and Tarsus may be related to the presence of Italo-Normans in those cities while Amalfi and Bari were under Norman rule in Italy.\n\nQuestion: Who did the Normans team up with in Anatolia?\n\nAnswer:", " unanswerable"]], "resps": [["  Turkish forces"], [[-13.3984375, false]]], "filtered_resps": ["  Turkish forces", [-13.3984375, false]], "filter": "none", "metrics": ["exact", "f1", "HasAns_exact", "HasAns_f1", "NoAns_exact", "NoAns_f1", "best_exact", "best_f1"], "doc_hash": "06d54f6f17755ffa0663b8cd805c53bfe732c1b51c0cd9931605f196fcdf08e5", "prompt_hash": "ba7e03733914f869ad2ecb85409258b21457f8ac4507c7ae1a62c25a0469a660", "target_hash": "5c6157f8f082d1bb9e4903131cf79295482e1db2a7a24e7c9e8b6b4117b56863", "exact": [{"id": "56de10b44396321400ee2595", "prediction_text": "  Turkish forces", "no_answer_probability": 1.517513375323305e-06}, {"id": "56de10b44396321400ee2595", "answers": {"text": ["Turkish forces", "Turkish forces", "Turkish forces"], "answer_start": [20, 20, 20]}}], "f1": [{"id": "56de10b44396321400ee2595", "prediction_text": "  Turkish forces", "no_answer_probability": 1.517513375323305e-06}, {"id": "56de10b44396321400ee2595", "answers": {"text": ["Turkish forces", "Turkish forces", "Turkish forces"], "answer_start": [20, 20, 20]}}], "HasAns_exact": [{"id": "56de10b44396321400ee2595", "prediction_text": "  Turkish forces", "no_answer_probability": 1.517513375323305e-06}, {"id": "56de10b44396321400ee2595", "answers": {"text": ["Turkish forces", "Turkish forces", "Turkish forces"], "answer_start": [20, 20, 20]}}], "HasAns_f1": [{"id": "56de10b44396321400ee2595", "prediction_text": "  Turkish forces", "no_answer_probability": 1.517513375323305e-06}, {"id": "56de10b44396321400ee2595", "answers": {"text": ["Turkish forces", "Turkish forces", "Turkish forces"], "answer_start": [20, 20, 20]}}], "NoAns_exact": [{"id": "56de10b44396321400ee2595", "prediction_text": "  Turkish forces", "no_answer_probability": 1.517513375323305e-06}, {"id": "56de10b44396321400ee2595", "answers": {"text": ["Turkish forces", "Turkish forces", "Turkish forces"], "answer_start": [20, 20, 20]}}], "NoAns_f1": [{"id": "56de10b44396321400ee2595", "prediction_text": "  Turkish forces", "no_answer_probability": 1.517513375323305e-06}, {"id": "56de10b44396321400ee2595", "answers": {"text": ["Turkish forces", "Turkish forces", "Turkish forces"], "answer_start": [20, 20, 20]}}], "best_exact": [{"id": "56de10b44396321400ee2595", "prediction_text": "  Turkish forces", "no_answer_probability": 1.517513375323305e-06}, {"id": "56de10b44396321400ee2595", "answers": {"text": ["Turkish forces", "Turkish forces", "Turkish forces"], "answer_start": [20, 20, 20]}}], "best_f1": [{"id": "56de10b44396321400ee2595", "prediction_text": "  Turkish forces", "no_answer_probability": 1.517513375323305e-06}, {"id": "56de10b44396321400ee2595", "answers": {"text": ["Turkish forces", "Turkish forces", "Turkish forces"], "answer_start": [20, 20, 20]}}]}, {"doc_id": 55, "doc": {"id": "5ad3e96b604f3c001a3ff689", "title": "Normans", "context": "Some Normans joined Turkish forces to aid in the destruction of the Armenians vassal-states of Sassoun and Taron in far eastern Anatolia.

Sumerian cylinder seals also depict houses built from reeds not unlike those built by the Marsh Arabs of Southern Iraq until as recently as 400 CE. The Sumerians also developed the arch, which enabled them to develop a strong type of dome. They built this by constructing and linking several arches.

The 33 1\u20443 rpm LP (for \"long-play\") format was developed by Columbia Records and marketed in June 1948. RCA Victor developed the 45 rpm format and marketed it in March 1949, each pursuing their own r&d in secret.

The most common ionic forms are U3+ (brown-red), U4+ (green), UO+\n2 (unstable), and UO2+\n2 (yellow), for U(III), U(IV), U(V), and U(VI), respectively. A few solid and semi-metallic compounds such as UO and US exist for the formal oxidation state uranium(II), but no simple ions are known to exist in solution for that state. Ions of U3+ liberate hydrogen from water and are therefore considered to be highly unstable. The UO2+\n2 ion represents the uranium(VI) state and is known to form compounds such as uranyl carbonate, uranyl chloride and uranyl sulfate. UO2+\n2 also forms complexes with various organic chelating agents, the most commonly encountered of which is uranyl acetate.\n\nQuestion: What state is represented by the UO2+ 2 ion?\n\nAnswer:  uranium(VI)\n\nTitle: Punjab,_Pakistan\n\nBackground: Punjab during Mahabharata times was known as Panchanada. Punjab was part of the Indus Valley Civilization, more than 4000 years ago. The main site in Punjab was the city of Harrapa. The Indus Valley Civilization spanned much of what is today Pakistan and eventually evolved into the Indo-Aryan civilisation. The Vedic civilisation flourished along the length of the Indus River. This civilisation shaped subsequent cultures in South Asia and Afghanistan. Although the archaeological site at Harappa was partially damaged in 1857 when engineers constructing the Lahore-Multan railroad used brick from the Harappa ruins for track ballast, an abundance of artefacts have nevertheless been found. Punjab was part of the great ancient empires including the Gandhara Mahajanapadas, Achaemenids, Macedonians, Mauryas, Kushans, Guptas, and Hindu Shahi. It also comprised the Gujar empire for a period of time, otherwise known as the Gurjara-Pratihara empire.

Food that could last for several days and could be eaten without heating was preferred. The scarcity of water and fresh green vegetables have all had their effect on the cooking. It is known for its snacks like Bikaneri Bhujia. Other famous dishes include bajre ki roti (millet bread) and lashun ki chutney (hot garlic paste), mawa kachori Mirchi Bada, Pyaaj Kachori and ghevar from Jodhpur, Alwar ka Mawa(Milk Cake), malpauas from Pushkar and rassgollas from Bikaner. Originating from the Marwar region of the state is the concept Marwari Bhojnalaya, or vegetarian restaurants, today found in many parts of India, which offer vegetarian food of the Marwari people. 4 Dal-Bati-Churma is very popular in Rajasthan. The traditional way to serve it is to first coarsely mash the Baati then pour pure Ghee on top of it. It is served with the daal (lentils) and spicy garlic chutney. Also served with Besan (gram flour) ki kadi. It is commonly served at all festivities, including religious occasions, wedding ceremonies, and birthday parties in Rajasthan. \"Dal-Baati-Churma\", is a combination of three different food items \u2014 Daal (lentils), Baati and Churma (Sweet). It is a typical Rajasthani dish.\n\nQuestion: Along with scarce green vegetables, what had an impact on Rajasthani cooking?\n\nAnswer:  scarcity of water\n\nTitle: Rajasthan\n\nBackground: The geographic features of Rajasthan are the Thar Desert and the Aravalli Range, which runs through the state from southwest to northeast, almost from one end to the other, for more than 850 kilometres (530 mi). Mount Abu lies at the southwestern end of the range, separated from the main ranges by the West Banas River, although a series of broken ridges continues into Haryana in the direction of Delhi where it can be seen as outcrops in the form of the Raisina Hill and the ridges farther north. About three-fifths of Rajasthan lies northwest of the Aravallis, leaving two-fifths on the east and south direction.\n\nQuestion: Where at the range does Delhi lie?\n\nAnswer:  unanswerable\n\nTitle: ASCII\n\nBackground: The inherent ambiguity of many control characters, combined with their historical usage, created problems when transferring \"plain text\" files between systems. The best example of this is the newline problem on various operating systems. Teletype machines required that a line of text be terminated with both \"Carriage Return\" (which moves the printhead to the beginning of the line) and \"Line Feed\" (which advances the paper one line without moving the printhead). The name \"Carriage Return\" comes from the fact that on a manual typewriter the carriage holding the paper moved while the position where the typebars struck the ribbon remained stationary. The entire carriage had to be pushed (returned) to the right in order to position the left margin of the paper for the next line.\n\nQuestion: Why were problems created when transferring files between systems?\n\nAnswer:  The inherent ambiguity of many control characters, combined with their historical usage\n\nTitle: Mary_(mother_of_Jesus)\n\nBackground: The Qur'an relates detailed narrative accounts of Maryam (Mary) in two places, Qur'an 3:35\u201347 and 19:16\u201334. These state beliefs in both the Immaculate Conception of Mary and the Virgin birth of Jesus. The account given in Sura 19 is nearly identical with that in the Gospel according to Luke, and both of these (Luke, Sura 19) begin with an account of the visitation of an angel upon Zakariya (Zecharias) and Good News of the birth of Yahya (John), followed by the account of the annunciation. It mentions how Mary was informed by an angel that she would become the mother of Jesus through the actions of God alone.\n\nQuestion: Who wrote the detailed narrative accounts of Maryam?\n\nAnswer:  unanswerable\n\nTitle: Estonia\n\nBackground: Modern Estonia is a fairly ethnically heterogeneous country, but this heterogeneity is not a feature of much of the country as the non-Estonian population is concentrated in two of Estonia's counties. Thirteen of Estonia's 15 counties are over 80% ethnic Estonian, the most homogeneous being Hiiumaa, where Estonians account for 98.4% of the population. In the counties of Harju (including the capital city, Tallinn) and Ida-Viru, however, ethnic Estonians make up 60% and 20% of the population, respectively. Russians make up 25.6% of the total population but account for 36% of the population in Harju county and 70% of the population in Ida-Viru county.\n\nQuestion: How many counties are in Estonia?\n\nAnswer:  15\n\nTitle: Karl_Popper\n\nBackground: Karl Popper's rejection of Marxism during his teenage years left a profound mark on his thought. He had at one point joined a socialist association, and for a few months in 1919 considered himself a communist. During this time he became familiar with the Marxist view of economics, class-war, and history. Although he quickly became disillusioned with the views expounded by Marxism, his flirtation with the ideology led him to distance himself from those who believed that spilling blood for the sake of a revolution was necessary. He came to realise that when it came to sacrificing human lives, one was to think and act with extreme prudence.\n\nQuestion: In what year did Popper consider himself a fascist for a few months? \n\nAnswer:  unanswerable\n\nTitle: Normans\n\nBackground: Some Normans joined Turkish forces to aid in the destruction of the Armenians vassal-states of Sassoun and Taron in far eastern Anatolia. Later, many took up service with the Armenian state further south in Cilicia and the Taurus Mountains. A Norman named Oursel led a force of \"Franks\" into the upper Euphrates valley in northern Syria. From 1073 to 1074, 8,000 of the 20,000 troops of the Armenian general Philaretus Brachamius were Normans\u2014formerly of Oursel\u2014led by Raimbaud. They even lent their ethnicity to the name of their castle: Afranji, meaning \"Franks.\" The known trade between Amalfi and Antioch and between Bari and Tarsus may be related to the presence of Italo-Normans in those cities while Amalfi and Bari were under Norman rule in Italy.\n\nQuestion: Who did the Turks take up service with?\n\nAnswer:", {"until": ["\n"]}], ["Title: Rajasthan\n\nBackground: Rajasthani cooking was influenced by both the war-like lifestyles of its inhabitants and the availability of ingredients in this arid region. Food that could last for several days and could be eaten without heating was preferred. The scarcity of water and fresh green vegetables have all had their effect on the cooking. It is known for its snacks like Bikaneri Bhujia. Other famous dishes include bajre ki roti (millet bread) and lashun ki chutney (hot garlic paste), mawa kachori Mirchi Bada, Pyaaj Kachori and ghevar from Jodhpur, Alwar ka Mawa(Milk Cake), malpauas from Pushkar and rassgollas from Bikaner. Originating from the Marwar region of the state is the concept Marwari Bhojnalaya, or vegetarian restaurants, today found in many parts of India, which offer vegetarian food of the Marwari people. 4 Dal-Bati-Churma is very popular in Rajasthan. The traditional way to serve it is to first coarsely mash the Baati then pour pure Ghee on top of it. It is served with the daal (lentils) and spicy garlic chutney. Also served with Besan (gram flour) ki kadi. It is commonly served at all festivities, including religious occasions, wedding ceremonies, and birthday parties in Rajasthan. \"Dal-Baati-Churma\", is a combination of three different food items \u2014 Daal (lentils), Baati and Churma (Sweet).

New Haven's theocratic history is also mentioned several times by Alexis de Tocqueville in his classic volume on 19th-century American political life, Democracy in America. New Haven was the residence of conservative thinker William F. Buckley, Jr., in 1951, when he wrote his influential God and Man at Yale.

Simultaneously he condemned the brutal Soviet invasion of Hungary in response to the Hungarian Revolution of 1956. He publicly disavowed his allies at the United Nations, and used financial and diplomatic pressure to make them withdraw from Egypt.

After Jedlik solved the technical problems of the continuous rotation with the invention of the commutator, he called his early devices \"electromagnetic self-rotors\". Although they were used only for instructional purposes, in 1828 Jedlik demonstrated the first device to contain the three main components of practical DC motors: the stator, rotor and commutator. The device employed no permanent magnets, as the magnetic fields of both the stationary and revolving components were produced solely by the currents flowing through their windings.\n\nQuestion: Besides the stator and the communicator, what is an element of a DC motor?\n\nAnswer:  rotor\n\nTitle: Circadian_rhythm\n\nBackground: It is now known that the molecular circadian clock can function within a single cell; i.e., it is cell-autonomous. This was shown by Gene Block in isolated mollusk BRNs.[clarification needed] At the same time, different cells may communicate with each other resulting in a synchronised output of electrical signaling. These may interface with endocrine glands of the brain to result in periodic release of hormones. The receptors for these hormones may be located far across the body and synchronise the peripheral clocks of various organs. Thus, the information of the time of the day as relayed by the eyes travels to the clock in the brain, and, through that, clocks in the rest of the body may be synchronised. This is how the timing of, for example, sleep/wake, body temperature, thirst, and appetite are coordinately controlled by the biological clock.[citation needed]\n\nQuestion: What is timed independently of the biological clock?\n\nAnswer:  unanswerable\n\nTitle: Qing_dynasty\n\nBackground: In the wake of these external defeats, the Guangxu Emperor initiated the Hundred Days' Reform of 1898.

The emperor issued a series of edicts and plans were made to reorganize the bureaucracy, restructure the school system, and appoint new officials. Opposition from the bureaucracy was immediate and intense. Although she had been involved in the initial reforms, the empress dowager stepped in to call them off, arrested and executed several reformers, and took over day-to-day control of policy. Yet many of the plans stayed in place, and the goals of reform were implanted.\n\nQuestion: Who took over the policy of China?\n\nAnswer:  empress dowager\n\nTitle: Normans\n\nBackground: Several families of Byzantine Greece were of Norman mercenary origin during the period of the Comnenian Restoration, when Byzantine emperors were seeking out western European warriors.

It has been found that this was based on prejudice and misinformation.\n\nQuestion: Has the cause for sexual orientation been found yet?\n\nAnswer:  The exact causes for the development of a particular sexual orientation have yet to be established\n\nTitle: Electric_motor\n\nBackground: In 1827, Hungarian physicist \u00c1nyos Jedlik started experimenting with electromagnetic coils. After Jedlik solved the technical problems of the continuous rotation with the invention of the commutator, he called his early devices \"electromagnetic self-rotors\". Although they were used only for instructional purposes, in 1828 Jedlik demonstrated the first device to contain the three main components of practical DC motors: the stator, rotor and commutator. The device employed no permanent magnets, as the magnetic fields of both the stationary and revolving components were produced solely by the currents flowing through their windings.\n\nQuestion: Besides the stator and the communicator, what is an element of a DC motor?\n\nAnswer:  rotor\n\nTitle: Circadian_rhythm\n\nBackground: It is now known that the molecular circadian clock can function within a single cell; i.e., it is cell-autonomous. This was shown by Gene Block in isolated mollusk BRNs.[clarification needed] At the same time, different cells may communicate with each other resulting in a synchronised output of electrical signaling. These may interface with endocrine glands of the brain to result in periodic release of hormones. The receptors for these hormones may be located far across the body and synchronise the peripheral clocks of various organs. Thus, the information of the time of the day as relayed by the eyes travels to the clock in the brain, and, through that, clocks in the rest of the body may be synchronised. This is how the timing of, for example, sleep/wake, body temperature, thirst, and appetite are coordinately controlled by the biological clock.[citation needed]\n\nQuestion: What is timed independently of the biological clock?\n\nAnswer:  unanswerable\n\nTitle: Qing_dynasty\n\nBackground: In the wake of these external defeats, the Guangxu Emperor initiated the Hundred Days' Reform of 1898. Newer, more radical advisers such as Kang Youwei were given positions of influence. The emperor issued a series of edicts and plans were made to reorganize the bureaucracy, restructure the school system, and appoint new officials. Opposition from the bureaucracy was immediate and intense. Although she had been involved in the initial reforms, the empress dowager stepped in to call them off, arrested and executed several reformers, and took over day-to-day control of policy. Yet many of the plans stayed in place, and the goals of reform were implanted.\n\nQuestion: Who took over the policy of China?\n\nAnswer:  empress dowager\n\nTitle: Normans\n\nBackground: Several families of Byzantine Greece were of Norman mercenary origin during the period of the Comnenian Restoration, when Byzantine emperors were seeking out western European warriors. The Raoulii were descended from an Italo-Norman named Raoul, the Petraliphae were descended from a Pierre d'Aulps, and that group of Albanian clans known as the Maniakates were descended from Normans who served under George Maniaces in the Sicilian expedition of 1038.\n\nQuestion: What were the origins of the Raouliii family?\n\nAnswer:", " unanswerable"]], "resps": [["  Byzantine Greece were of Norman mercenary origin during the period of the Comnenian Restoration"], [[-12.1171875, false]]], "filtered_resps": ["  Byzantine Greece were of Norman mercenary origin during the period of the Comnenian Restoration", [-12.1171875, false]], "filter": "none", "metrics": ["exact", "f1", "HasAns_exact", "HasAns_f1", "NoAns_exact", "NoAns_f1", "best_exact", "best_f1"], "doc_hash": "57fc8eaaa8ff1538be2dcf31ca63689648e59a511b84fd403bbf628a091fa353", "prompt_hash": "2c8d79791ab0dc88394bbc84ffc4c9174e837cc06f11aceddd4f26f6a5a465e7", "target_hash": "f6093fe2349fbf82a79aaa1bee540ae1b8b720c6241dbc74fc982d6bfcee0900", "exact": [{"id": "56de11154396321400ee25aa", "prediction_text": "  Byzantine Greece were of Norman mercenary origin during the period of the Comnenian Restoration", "no_answer_probability": 5.464775591682541e-06}, {"id": "56de11154396321400ee25aa", "answers": {"text": ["Norman mercenary", "an Italo-Norman named Raoul", "descended from an Italo-Norman named Raoul"], "answer_start": [45, 217, 202]}}], "f1": [{"id": "56de11154396321400ee25aa", "prediction_text": "  Byzantine Greece were of Norman mercenary origin during the period of the Comnenian Restoration", "no_answer_probability": 5.464775591682541e-06}, {"id": "56de11154396321400ee25aa", "answers": {"text": ["Norman mercenary", "an Italo-Norman named Raoul", "descended from an Italo-Norman named Raoul"], "answer_start": [45, 217, 202]}}], "HasAns_exact": [{"id": "56de11154396321400ee25aa", "prediction_text": "  Byzantine Greece were of Norman mercenary origin during the period of the Comnenian Restoration", "no_answer_probability": 5.464775591682541e-06}, {"id": "56de11154396321400ee25aa", "answers": {"text": ["Norman mercenary", "an Italo-Norman named Raoul", "descended from an Italo-Norman named Raoul"], "answer_start": [45, 217, 202]}}], "HasAns_f1": [{"id": "56de11154396321400ee25aa", "prediction_text": "  Byzantine Greece were of Norman mercenary origin during the period of the Comnenian Restoration", "no_answer_probability": 5.464775591682541e-06}, {"id": "56de11154396321400ee25aa", "answers": {"text": ["Norman mercenary", "an Italo-Norman named Raoul", "descended from an Italo-Norman named Raoul"], "answer_start": [45, 217, 202]}}], "NoAns_exact": [{"id": "56de11154396321400ee25aa", "prediction_text": "  Byzantine Greece were of Norman mercenary origin during the period of the Comnenian Restoration", "no_answer_probability": 5.464775591682541e-06}, {"id": "56de11154396321400ee25aa", "answers": {"text": ["Norman mercenary", "an Italo-Norman named Raoul", "descended from an Italo-Norman named Raoul"], "answer_start": [45, 217, 202]}}], "NoAns_f1": [{"id": "56de11154396321400ee25aa", "prediction_text": "  Byzantine Greece were of Norman mercenary origin during the period of the Comnenian Restoration", "no_answer_probability": 5.464775591682541e-06}, {"id": "56de11154396321400ee25aa", "answers": {"text": ["Norman mercenary", "an Italo-Norman named Raoul", "descended from an Italo-Norman named Raoul"], "answer_start": [45, 217, 202]}}], "best_exact": [{"id": "56de11154396321400ee25aa", "prediction_text": "  Byzantine Greece were of Norman mercenary origin during the period of the Comnenian Restoration", "no_answer_probability": 5.464775591682541e-06}, {"id": "56de11154396321400ee25aa", "answers": {"text": ["Norman mercenary", "an Italo-Norman named Raoul", "descended from an Italo-Norman named Raoul"], "answer_start": [45, 217, 202]}}], "best_f1": [{"id": "56de11154396321400ee25aa", "prediction_text": "  Byzantine Greece were of Norman mercenary origin during the period of the Comnenian Restoration", "no_answer_probability": 5.464775591682541e-06}, {"id": "56de11154396321400ee25aa", "answers": {"text": ["Norman mercenary", "an Italo-Norman named Raoul", "descended from an Italo-Norman named Raoul"], "answer_start": [45, 217, 202]}}]}, {"doc_id": 60, "doc": {"id": "5ad3ea79604f3c001a3ff6e9", "title": "Normans", "context": "Several families of Byzantine Greece were of Norman mercenary origin during the period of the Comnenian Restoration, when Byzantine emperors were seeking out western European warriors.

The Vedas are among the oldest sacred texts. The Samhitas (vedic collections) date to roughly 1500\u20131000 BCE, and the \"circum-Vedic\" texts, as well as the redaction of the Samhitas, date to c. 1000-500 BCE, resulting in a Vedic period, spanning the mid 2nd to mid 1st millennium BCE, or the Late Bronze Age and the Iron Age.

The small areas of the screens (16 by 16 pixels) meant that character designers had to create monsters whose forms would be easily recognizable. As such, many of the early Digimon\u2014including Tyrannomon, the first one ever created\u2014were based on dinosaurs. Many further designs were created by Kenji Watanabe, who was brought in to help with the \"X-Antibody\" creatures and art for the Digimon collectible card game. Watanabe was one influenced by American comics, which were beginning to gain popularity in Japan, and as such began to make his characters look stronger and \"cool.\" The character creation process, however, has for most of the franchise's history been collaborative and reliant on conversation and brainstorming.\n\nQuestion: What kind of creatures where the early digimon patterned after?\n\nAnswer:  dinosaurs\n\nTitle: Hydrogen\n\nBackground: The energy levels of hydrogen can be calculated fairly accurately using the Bohr model of the atom, which conceptualizes the electron as \"orbiting\" the proton in analogy to the Earth's orbit of the Sun. However, the electromagnetic force attracts electrons and protons to one another, while planets and celestial objects are attracted to each other by gravity. Because of the discretization of angular momentum postulated in early quantum mechanics by Bohr, the electron in the Bohr model can only occupy certain allowed distances from the proton, and therefore only certain allowed energies.\n\nQuestion: What does the electromagnetic force attract to one another?\n\nAnswer:  electrons and protons\n\nTitle: Flowering_plant\n\nBackground: Island genetics provides one proposed explanation for the sudden, fully developed appearance of flowering plants. Island genetics is believed to be a common source of speciation in general, especially when it comes to radical adaptations that seem to have required inferior transitional forms. Flowering plants may have evolved in an isolated setting like an island or island chain, where the plants bearing them were able to develop a highly specialized relationship with some specific animal (a wasp, for example). Such a relationship, with a hypothetical wasp carrying pollen from one plant to another much the way fig wasps do today, could result in the development of a high degree of specialization in both the plant(s) and their partners. Note that the wasp example is not incidental; bees, which, it is postulated, evolved specifically due to mutualistic plant relationships, are descended from wasps.\n\nQuestion: What are transitional forms descended from?\n\nAnswer:  unanswerable\n\nTitle: Himachal_Pradesh\n\nBackground: Himachal Pradesh is governed through a parliamentary system of representative democracy, a feature the state shares with other Indian states. Universal suffrage is granted to residents. The legislature consists of elected members and special office bearers such as the Speaker and the Deputy Speaker who are elected by the members. Assembly meetings are presided over by the Speaker or the Deputy Speaker in the Speaker's absence. The judiciary is composed of the Himachal Pradesh High Court and a system of lower courts. Executive authority is vested in the Council of Ministers headed by the Chief Minister, although the titular head of government is the Governor. The Governor is the head of state appointed by the President of India. The leader of the party or coalition with a majority in the Legislative Assembly is appointed as the Chief Minister by the Governor, and the Council of Ministers are appointed by the Governor on the advice of the Chief Minister. The Council of Ministers reports to the Legislative Assembly. The Assembly is unicameral with 68 Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLA). Terms of office run for 5 years, unless the Assembly is dissolved prior to the completion of the term. Auxiliary authorities known as panchayats, for which local body elections are regularly held, govern local affairs.\n\nQuestion: Who is the head of state appointed by the lower courts?\n\nAnswer:  unanswerable\n\nTitle: United_States_dollar\n\nBackground: The U.S. Constitution provides that Congress shall have the power to \"borrow money on the credit of the United States\". Congress has exercised that power by authorizing Federal Reserve Banks to issue Federal Reserve Notes. Those notes are \"obligations of the United States\" and \"shall be redeemed in lawful money on demand at the Treasury Department of the United States, in the city of Washington, District of Columbia, or at any Federal Reserve bank\". Federal Reserve Notes are designated by law as \"legal tender\" for the payment of debts. Congress has also authorized the issuance of more than 10 other types of banknotes, including the United States Note and the Federal Reserve Bank Note. The Federal Reserve Note is the only type that remains in circulation since the 1970s.\n\nQuestion: Since the 1970s, what is the only type of note that have been designated?\n\nAnswer:  unanswerable\n\nTitle: Asphalt\n\nBackground: Asphalt/bitumen is typically stored and transported at temperatures around 150 \u00b0C (302 \u00b0F). Sometimes diesel oil or kerosene are mixed in before shipping to retain liquidity; upon delivery, these lighter materials are separated out of the mixture. This mixture is often called \"bitumen feedstock\", or BFS. Some dump trucks route the hot engine exhaust through pipes in the dump body to keep the material warm.

The small areas of the screens (16 by 16 pixels) meant that character designers had to create monsters whose forms would be easily recognizable. As such, many of the early Digimon\u2014including Tyrannomon, the first one ever created\u2014were based on dinosaurs. Many further designs were created by Kenji Watanabe, who was brought in to help with the \"X-Antibody\" creatures and art for the Digimon collectible card game. Watanabe was one influenced by American comics, which were beginning to gain popularity in Japan, and as such began to make his characters look stronger and \"cool.\" The character creation process, however, has for most of the franchise's history been collaborative and reliant on conversation and brainstorming.\n\nQuestion: What kind of creatures where the early digimon patterned after?\n\nAnswer:  dinosaurs\n\nTitle: Hydrogen\n\nBackground: The energy levels of hydrogen can be calculated fairly accurately using the Bohr model of the atom, which conceptualizes the electron as \"orbiting\" the proton in analogy to the Earth's orbit of the Sun. However, the electromagnetic force attracts electrons and protons to one another, while planets and celestial objects are attracted to each other by gravity. Because of the discretization of angular momentum postulated in early quantum mechanics by Bohr, the electron in the Bohr model can only occupy certain allowed distances from the proton, and therefore only certain allowed energies.\n\nQuestion: What does the electromagnetic force attract to one another?\n\nAnswer:  electrons and protons\n\nTitle: Flowering_plant\n\nBackground: Island genetics provides one proposed explanation for the sudden, fully developed appearance of flowering plants. Island genetics is believed to be a common source of speciation in general, especially when it comes to radical adaptations that seem to have required inferior transitional forms. Flowering plants may have evolved in an isolated setting like an island or island chain, where the plants bearing them were able to develop a highly specialized relationship with some specific animal (a wasp, for example). Such a relationship, with a hypothetical wasp carrying pollen from one plant to another much the way fig wasps do today, could result in the development of a high degree of specialization in both the plant(s) and their partners. Note that the wasp example is not incidental; bees, which, it is postulated, evolved specifically due to mutualistic plant relationships, are descended from wasps.\n\nQuestion: What are transitional forms descended from?\n\nAnswer:  unanswerable\n\nTitle: Himachal_Pradesh\n\nBackground: Himachal Pradesh is governed through a parliamentary system of representative democracy, a feature the state shares with other Indian states. Universal suffrage is granted to residents. The legislature consists of elected members and special office bearers such as the Speaker and the Deputy Speaker who are elected by the members. Assembly meetings are presided over by the Speaker or the Deputy Speaker in the Speaker's absence. The judiciary is composed of the Himachal Pradesh High Court and a system of lower courts. Executive authority is vested in the Council of Ministers headed by the Chief Minister, although the titular head of government is the Governor. The Governor is the head of state appointed by the President of India. The leader of the party or coalition with a majority in the Legislative Assembly is appointed as the Chief Minister by the Governor, and the Council of Ministers are appointed by the Governor on the advice of the Chief Minister. The Council of Ministers reports to the Legislative Assembly. The Assembly is unicameral with 68 Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLA). Terms of office run for 5 years, unless the Assembly is dissolved prior to the completion of the term. Auxiliary authorities known as panchayats, for which local body elections are regularly held, govern local affairs.\n\nQuestion: Who is the head of state appointed by the lower courts?\n\nAnswer:  unanswerable\n\nTitle: United_States_dollar\n\nBackground: The U.S. Constitution provides that Congress shall have the power to \"borrow money on the credit of the United States\". Congress has exercised that power by authorizing Federal Reserve Banks to issue Federal Reserve Notes. Those notes are \"obligations of the United States\" and \"shall be redeemed in lawful money on demand at the Treasury Department of the United States, in the city of Washington, District of Columbia, or at any Federal Reserve bank\". Federal Reserve Notes are designated by law as \"legal tender\" for the payment of debts. Congress has also authorized the issuance of more than 10 other types of banknotes, including the United States Note and the Federal Reserve Bank Note. The Federal Reserve Note is the only type that remains in circulation since the 1970s.\n\nQuestion: Since the 1970s, what is the only type of note that have been designated?\n\nAnswer:  unanswerable\n\nTitle: Asphalt\n\nBackground: Asphalt/bitumen is typically stored and transported at temperatures around 150 \u00b0C (302 \u00b0F). Sometimes diesel oil or kerosene are mixed in before shipping to retain liquidity; upon delivery, these lighter materials are separated out of the mixture. This mixture is often called \"bitumen feedstock\", or BFS. Some dump trucks route the hot engine exhaust through pipes in the dump body to keep the material warm. The backs of tippers carrying asphalt/bitumen, as well as some handling equipment, are also commonly sprayed with a releasing agent before filling to aid release. Diesel oil is no longer used as a release agent due to environmental concerns.\n\nQuestion: Diesel oil or kerosene is often mixed into what to retain warmth? \n\nAnswer:  unanswerable\n\nTitle: Normans\n\nBackground: Several families of Byzantine Greece were of Norman mercenary origin during the period of the Comnenian Restoration, when Byzantine emperors were seeking out western European warriors.

Being a largely ground-dwelling, gregarious bird, domestication of the quail was not difficult, although many of its wild instincts are retained in captivity. It was known to the Egyptians long before the arrival of chickens and was depicted in hieroglyphs from 2575 BC. It migrated across Egypt in vast flocks and the birds could sometimes be picked up off the ground by hand. These were the common quail (Coturnix coturnix), but modern domesticated flocks are mostly of Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) which was probably domesticated as early as the 11th century AD in Japan.

Mortality has decreased over the last few decades due to better recognition and improvement in care. Globally it causes moderate or severe disability in 19.4 million people as of 2004 (16 million of which are in low and middle income countries). Of asthma diagnosed during childhood, half of cases will no longer carry the diagnosis after a decade.

Unpredictable weather is expected, given that temperatures can drop to 1 \u00b0C (34 \u00b0F) or less during the winter. During a 2013 cold front, the winter temperatures of Kathmandu dropped to \u22124 \u00b0C (25 \u00b0F), and the lowest temperature was recorded on January 10, 2013, at \u22129.2 \u00b0C (15.4 \u00b0F). Rainfall is mostly monsoon-based (about 65% of the total concentrated during the monsoon months of June to August), and decreases substantially (100 to 200 cm (39 to 79 in)) from eastern Nepal to western Nepal. Rainfall has been recorded at about 1,400 millimetres (55.1 in) for the Kathmandu valley, and averages 1,407 millimetres (55.4 in) for the city of Kathmandu. On average humidity is 75%. The chart below is based on data from the Nepal Bureau of Standards & Meteorology, \"Weather Meteorology\" for 2005. The chart provides minimum and maximum temperatures during each month. The annual amount of precipitation was 1,124 millimetres (44.3 in) for 2005, as per monthly data included in the table above. The decade of 2000-2010 saw highly variable and unprecedented precipitation anomalies in Kathmandu. This was mostly due to the annual variation of the southwest monsoon.[citation needed] For example, 2003 was the wettest year ever in Kathmandu, totalling over 2,900 mm (114 in) of precipitation due to an exceptionally strong monsoon season.

By 1879 it had grown to ten thousand volumes that were housed in the Main Building.\n\nQuestion: Which individual began a library at Notre Dame?\n\nAnswer:  Father Lemonnier\n\nTitle: Somalis\n\nBackground: Qur'anic schools (also known as dugsi) remain the basic system of traditional religious instruction in Somalia. They provide Islamic education for children, thereby filling a clear religious and social role in the country. Known as the most stable local, non-formal system of education providing basic religious and moral instruction, their strength rests on community support and their use of locally made and widely available teaching materials. The Qur'anic system, which teaches the greatest number of students relative to other educational sub-sectors, is oftentimes the only system accessible to Somalis in nomadic as compared to urban areas. A study from 1993 found, among other things, that \"unlike in primary schools where gender disparity is enormous, around 40 per cent of Qur'anic school pupils are girls; but the teaching staff have minimum or no qualification necessary to ensure intellectual development of children.\" To address these concerns, the Somali government on its own part subsequently established the Ministry of Endowment and Islamic Affairs, under which Qur'anic education is now regulated.\n\nQuestion: What government body regulates Qur'anic education?\n\nAnswer:  the Ministry of Endowment and Islamic Affairs\n\nTitle: George_VI\n\nBackground: In a time when royals were expected to marry fellow royals, it was unusual that Albert had a great deal of freedom in choosing a prospective wife. An infatuation with the already-married Australian socialite Sheila, Lady Loughborough, came to an end in April 1920 when the King, with the promise of the dukedom of York, persuaded Albert to stop seeing her. That year, he met for the first time since childhood Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, the youngest daughter of the Earl and Countess of Strathmore and Kinghorne. He became determined to marry her. She rejected his proposal twice, in 1921 and 1922, reportedly because she was reluctant to make the sacrifices necessary to become a member of the royal family. In the words of Lady Elizabeth's mother, Albert would be \"made or marred\" by his choice of wife. After a protracted courtship, Elizabeth agreed to marry him.\n\nQuestion: Who was Albert infatuated with?\n\nAnswer:  Sheila, Lady Loughborough\n\nTitle: Nanjing\n\nBackground: In the 1950s after PRC was established by CPC, the government invested heavily in the city to build a series of state-owned heavy industries, as part of the national plan of rapid industrialization, converting it into a heavy industry production centre of East China. Overenthusiastic in building a \u201cworld-class\u201d industrial city, the government also made many disastrous mistakes during development, such as spending hundreds of millions of yuan to mine for non-existent coal, resulting in negative economic growth in the late 1960s. From 1960s to 1980s there were Five Pillar Industries, namely, electronics, cars, petrochemical, iron and steel, and power, each with big state-owned firms. After the Reform and Opening recovering market economy, the state-owned enterprises found themselves incapable of competing with efficient multinational firms and local private firms, hence were either mired in heavy debt or forced into bankruptcy or privatization and this resulted in large numbers of layoff workers who were technically not unemployed but effectively jobless.\n\nQuestion: The mistakes the government made during this period resulted in what type of growth?\n\nAnswer:  negative economic growth\n\nTitle: Kathmandu\n\nBackground: Five major climatic regions are found in Nepal. Of these, Kathmandu Valley is in the Warm Temperate Zone (elevation ranging from 1,200\u20132,300 metres (3,900\u20137,500 ft)), where the climate is fairly temperate, atypical for the region. This zone is followed by the Cool Temperate Zone with elevation varying between 2,100\u20133,300 metres (6,900\u201310,800 ft). Under K\u00f6ppen's climate classification, portions of the city with lower elevations have a humid subtropical climate (Cwa), while portions of the city with higher elevations generally have a subtropical highland climate. In the Kathmandu Valley, which is representative of its valley's climate, the average summer temperature varies from 28\u201330 \u00b0C (82\u201386 \u00b0F).

Its urban area extends beyond the administrative city limits with a population of around 1.5 million people. Valencia is Spain's third largest metropolitan area, with a population ranging from 1.7 to 2.5 million. The city has global city status.

Having obtained the consent of pope Gregory VII and acting as his vassal, Robert continued his campaign conquering the Balkan peninsula as a foothold for western feudal lords and the Catholic Church. After allying himself with Croatia and the Catholic cities of Dalmatia, in 1081 he led an army of 30,000 men in 300 ships landing on the southern shores of Albania, capturing Valona, Kanina, Jericho (Orikumi), and reaching Butrint after numerous pillages. They joined the fleet that had previously conquered Corfu and attacked Dyrrachium from land and sea, devastating everything along the way. Under these harsh circumstances, the locals accepted the call of emperor Alexius I Comnenus to join forces with the Byzantines against the Normans. The Albanian forces could not take part in the ensuing battle because it had started before their arrival. Immediately before the battle, the Venetian fleet had secured a victory in the coast surrounding the city. Forced to retreat, Alexius ceded the command to a high Albanian official named Comiscortes in the service of Byzantium. The city's garrison resisted until February 1082, when Dyrrachium was betrayed to the Normans by the Venetian and Amalfitan merchants who had settled there. The Normans were now free to penetrate into the hinterland; they took Ioannina and some minor cities in southwestern Macedonia and Thessaly before appearing at the gates of Thessalonica. Dissension among the high ranks coerced the Normans to retreat to Italy.

Trichromatic white LEDs are in between, having both good luminous efficacy (>70 lm/W) and fair color rendering capability.\n\nQuestion: What is one type of multi-color white LED?\n\nAnswer:  tetrachromatic\n\nTitle: Symbiosis\n\nBackground: Commensalism describes a relationship between two living organisms where one benefits and the other is not significantly harmed or helped. It is derived from the English word commensal used of human social interaction. The word derives from the medieval Latin word, formed from com- and mensa, meaning \"sharing a table\".\n\nQuestion: What word is derived from the medieval English word?\n\nAnswer:  unanswerable\n\nTitle: Normans\n\nBackground: Robert Guiscard, an other Norman adventurer previously elevated to the dignity of count of Apulia as the result of his military successes, ultimately drove the Byzantines out of southern Italy. Having obtained the consent of pope Gregory VII and acting as his vassal, Robert continued his campaign conquering the Balkan peninsula as a foothold for western feudal lords and the Catholic Church. After allying himself with Croatia and the Catholic cities of Dalmatia, in 1081 he led an army of 30,000 men in 300 ships landing on the southern shores of Albania, capturing Valona, Kanina, Jericho (Orikumi), and reaching Butrint after numerous pillages. They joined the fleet that had previously conquered Corfu and attacked Dyrrachium from land and sea, devastating everything along the way. Under these harsh circumstances, the locals accepted the call of emperor Alexius I Comnenus to join forces with the Byzantines against the Normans. The Albanian forces could not take part in the ensuing battle because it had started before their arrival. Immediately before the battle, the Venetian fleet had secured a victory in the coast surrounding the city. Forced to retreat, Alexius ceded the command to a high Albanian official named Comiscortes in the service of Byzantium. The city's garrison resisted until February 1082, when Dyrrachium was betrayed to the Normans by the Venetian and Amalfitan merchants who had settled there. The Normans were now free to penetrate into the hinterland; they took Ioannina and some minor cities in southwestern Macedonia and Thessaly before appearing at the gates of Thessalonica. Dissension among the high ranks coerced the Normans to retreat to Italy.

The response of the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, the Bank of England and other central banks was immediate and dramatic. During the last quarter of 2008, these central banks purchased US$2.5 trillion of government debt and troubled private assets from banks. This was the largest liquidity injection into the credit market, and the largest monetary policy action, in world history. Following a model initiated by the United Kingdom bank rescue package, the governments of European nations and the USA guaranteed the debt issued by their banks and raised the capital of their national banking systems, ultimately purchasing $1.5 trillion newly issued preferred stock in their major banks. In October 2010, Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz explained how the U.S. Federal Reserve was implementing another monetary policy \u2014creating currency\u2014 as a method to combat the liquidity trap. By creating $600 billion and inserting[clarification needed] this directly into banks, the Federal Reserve intended to spur banks to finance more domestic loans and refinance mortgages. However, banks instead were spending the money in more profitable areas by investing internationally in emerging markets. Banks were also investing in foreign currencies, which Stiglitz and others point out may lead to currency wars while China redirects its currency holdings away from the United States.\n\nQuestion: How much preferred stock did governments of European nations and the USA purchase in their major banks?\n\nAnswer:  $1.5 trillion\n\nTitle: Macintosh\n\nBackground: The current Mac product family uses Intel x86-64 processors. Apple introduced an emulator during the transition from PowerPC chips (called Rosetta), much as it did during the transition from Motorola 68000 architecture a decade earlier. The Macintosh is the only mainstream computer platform to have successfully transitioned to a new CPU architecture, and has done so twice. All current Mac models ship with at least 8 GB of RAM as standard other than the 1.4 GHz Mac Mini, MacBook Pro (without Retina Display), and MacBook Air. Current Mac computers use ATI Radeon or nVidia GeForce graphics cards as well as Intel graphics built into the main CPU. All current Macs (except for the MacBook Pro without Retina Display) do not ship with an optical media drive that includes a dual-function DVD/CD burner. Apple refers to this as a SuperDrive. Current Macs include two standard data transfer ports: USB and Thunderbolt (except for the MacBook (2015 version), which only has a USB-C port and headphone port). MacBook Pro, iMac, MacBook Air, and Mac Mini computers now also feature the \"Thunderbolt\" port, which Apple says can transfer data at speeds up to 10 gigabits per second. USB was introduced in the 1998 iMac G3 and is ubiquitous today, while FireWire is mainly reserved for high-performance devices such as hard drives or video cameras. Starting with the then-new iMac G5, released in October 2005, Apple started to include built-in iSight cameras on appropriate models, and a media center interface called Front Row that can be operated by an Apple Remote or keyboard for accessing media stored on the computer. Front Row has been discontinued as of 2011, however, and the Apple Remote is no longer bundled with new Macs.\n\nQuestion: When was the iMac G5 released?\n\nAnswer:  October 2005\n\nTitle: Emotion\n\nBackground: Robert Plutchik agreed with Ekman's biologically driven perspective but developed the \"wheel of emotions\", suggesting eight primary emotions grouped on a positive or negative basis: joy versus sadness; anger versus fear; trust versus disgust; and surprise versus anticipation. Some basic emotions can be modified to form complex emotions. The complex emotions could arise from cultural conditioning or association combined with the basic emotions. Alternatively, similar to the way primary colors combine, primary emotions could blend to form the full spectrum of human emotional experience. For example, interpersonal anger and disgust could blend to form contempt. Relationships exist between basic emotions, resulting in positive or negative influences.\n\nQuestion:  In Plutchik's theory, what emotion is the same as anticipation?\n\nAnswer:  unanswerable\n\nTitle: Paris\n\nBackground: According to Eurostat, the EU statistical agency, in 2012 the Commune of Paris was the most densely populated city in the European Union, with 21,616 people per square kilometre within the city limits (the NUTS-3 statistical area), ahead of Inner London West, which had 10,374 people per square kilometre. According to the same census, three departments bordering Paris, Hauts-de-Seine, Seine-Saint-Denis and Val-de-Marne, had population densities of over ten thousand people per square kilometre, ranking among the ten most densely populated areas of the EU.\n\nQuestion: How many people lived per square kilometer in the city limits?\n\nAnswer:  21,616\n\nTitle: Yale_University\n\nBackground: Several explanations have been offered for Yale\u2019s representation in national elections since the end of the Vietnam War.

The contiguous forty-eight states are otherwise bounded by the Pacific Ocean on the west, the Atlantic Ocean on the east, and the Gulf of Mexico to the southeast.

It is a subarctic oceanic climate in the southwest and a continental subarctic climate farther north. The temperature is somewhat moderate considering how far north the area is. This region has a tremendous amount of variety in precipitation. An area stretching from the northern side of the Seward Peninsula to the Kobuk River valley (i. e., the region around Kotzebue Sound) is technically a desert, with portions receiving less than 10 in (25 cm) of precipitation annually.

The critical apparatus presents the author's work in three parts: first, a list or description of the evidence that the editor used (names of manuscripts, or abbreviations called sigla); second, the editor's analysis of that evidence (sometimes a simple likelihood rating),[citation needed]; and third, a record of rejected variants of the text (often in order of preference).[citation needed]\n\nQuestion: What is included in the first part of the critical apparatus?\n\nAnswer:  a list or description of the evidence that the editor used (names of manuscripts, or abbreviations called sigla)\n\nTitle: Uranium\n\nBackground: On 2 December 1942, as part of the Manhattan Project, another team led by Enrico Fermi was able to initiate the first artificial self-sustained nuclear chain reaction, Chicago Pile-1. Working in a lab below the stands of Stagg Field at the University of Chicago, the team created the conditions needed for such a reaction by piling together 400 short tons (360 metric tons) of graphite, 58 short tons (53 metric tons) of uranium oxide, and six short tons (5.5 metric tons) of uranium metal, a majority of which was supplied by Westinghouse Lamp Plant in a makeshift production process.\n\nQuestion: On what date was the first self-sustained nuclear chain reaction created artificially?\n\nAnswer:  2 December 1942\n\nTitle: Muslim_world\n\nBackground: The term Muslim world, also known as Islamic world and the Ummah (Arabic: \u0623\u0645\u0629\u200e, meaning \"nation\" or \"community\") has different meanings. In a religious sense, the Islamic Ummah refers to those who adhere to the teachings of Islam, referred to as Muslims. In a cultural sense, the Muslim Ummah refers to Islamic civilization, exclusive of non-Muslims living in that civilization.

The contiguous forty-eight states are otherwise bounded by the Pacific Ocean on the west, the Atlantic Ocean on the east, and the Gulf of Mexico to the southeast. Alaska borders the Pacific Ocean to the south, the Bering Strait to the west, and the Arctic Ocean to the north, while Hawaii lies far to the southwest of the mainland in the Pacific Ocean.\n\nQuestion: Who does the US share water borders with in the northwest?\n\nAnswer:  Russia\n\nTitle: The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Twilight_Princess\n\nBackground: A CD containing 20 musical selections from the game was available as a GameStop preorder bonus in the United States; it is included in all bundles in Japan, Europe, and Australia.[citation needed]\n\nQuestion: What company included the soundtrack as a reward for ordering the CD prior to release?\n\nAnswer:  unanswerable\n\nTitle: Alaska\n\nBackground: The climate of Western Alaska is determined in large part by the Bering Sea and the Gulf of Alaska. It is a subarctic oceanic climate in the southwest and a continental subarctic climate farther north. The temperature is somewhat moderate considering how far north the area is. This region has a tremendous amount of variety in precipitation. An area stretching from the northern side of the Seward Peninsula to the Kobuk River valley (i. e., the region around Kotzebue Sound) is technically a desert, with portions receiving less than 10 in (25 cm) of precipitation annually. On the other extreme, some locations between Dillingham and Bethel average around 100 in (250 cm) of precipitation.\n\nQuestion: Is precipitation varied or uniform in Eastern Alaska?\n\nAnswer:  unanswerable\n\nTitle: Textual_criticism\n\nBackground: The textual critic's ultimate objective is the production of a \"critical edition\".[citation needed] This contains the text that the author has determined most closely approximates the original, and is accompanied by an apparatus criticus or critical apparatus. The critical apparatus presents the author's work in three parts: first, a list or description of the evidence that the editor used (names of manuscripts, or abbreviations called sigla); second, the editor's analysis of that evidence (sometimes a simple likelihood rating),[citation needed]; and third, a record of rejected variants of the text (often in order of preference).[citation needed]\n\nQuestion: What is included in the first part of the critical apparatus?\n\nAnswer:  a list or description of the evidence that the editor used (names of manuscripts, or abbreviations called sigla)\n\nTitle: Uranium\n\nBackground: On 2 December 1942, as part of the Manhattan Project, another team led by Enrico Fermi was able to initiate the first artificial self-sustained nuclear chain reaction, Chicago Pile-1. Working in a lab below the stands of Stagg Field at the University of Chicago, the team created the conditions needed for such a reaction by piling together 400 short tons (360 metric tons) of graphite, 58 short tons (53 metric tons) of uranium oxide, and six short tons (5.5 metric tons) of uranium metal, a majority of which was supplied by Westinghouse Lamp Plant in a makeshift production process.\n\nQuestion: On what date was the first self-sustained nuclear chain reaction created artificially?\n\nAnswer:  2 December 1942\n\nTitle: Muslim_world\n\nBackground: The term Muslim world, also known as Islamic world and the Ummah (Arabic: \u0623\u0645\u0629\u200e, meaning \"nation\" or \"community\") has different meanings. In a religious sense, the Islamic Ummah refers to those who adhere to the teachings of Islam, referred to as Muslims. In a cultural sense, the Muslim Ummah refers to Islamic civilization, exclusive of non-Muslims living in that civilization. In a modern geopolitical sense, the term \"Islamic Nation\" usually refers collectively to Muslim-majority countries, states, districts, or towns.\n\nQuestion: When speaking of religion, what does Ummah refer to?\n\nAnswer:  those who adhere to the teachings of Islam\n\nTitle: Normans\n\nBackground: Robert Guiscard, an other Norman adventurer previously elevated to the dignity of count of Apulia as the result of his military successes, ultimately drove the Byzantines out of southern Italy. Having obtained the consent of pope Gregory VII and acting as his vassal, Robert continued his campaign conquering the Balkan peninsula as a foothold for western feudal lords and the Catholic Church.

The city contains several theaters, including the National Dance Theatre in Kanti Path, the Ganga Theatre, the Himalayan Theatre and the Aarohan Theater Group founded in 1982. The M.

The kraft process, invented in the 1870s and first used in the 1890s, is now the most commonly practiced strategy, one of its advantages is the chemical reaction with lignin, that produces heat, which can be used to run a generator. Most pulping operations using the kraft process are net contributors to the electricity grid or use the electricity to run an adjacent paper mill. Another advantage is that this process recovers and reuses all inorganic chemical reagents. Soda pulping is another specialty process used to pulp straws, bagasse and hardwoods with high silicate content.\n\nQuestion: Invented in the 1870s, when was soda pulping first used?\n\nAnswer:  unanswerable\n\nTitle: Alfred_North_Whitehead\n\nBackground: In fact, process theology is difficult to define because process theologians are so diverse and transdisciplinary in their views and interests.

Little trade or commerce is known to have passed through the interior in subsequent periods, the only major exception being the Nile Valley. The Nile, however, was impassable at several cataracts, making trade and contact by boat difficult.\n\nQuestion: What features of the Nile made it ideal for trading?\n\nAnswer:  unanswerable\n\nTitle: Normans\n\nBackground: Robert Guiscard, an other Norman adventurer previously elevated to the dignity of count of Apulia as the result of his military successes, ultimately drove the Byzantines out of southern Italy. Having obtained the consent of pope Gregory VII and acting as his vassal, Robert continued his campaign conquering the Balkan peninsula as a foothold for western feudal lords and the Catholic Church. After allying himself with Croatia and the Catholic cities of Dalmatia, in 1081 he led an army of 30,000 men in 300 ships landing on the southern shores of Albania, capturing Valona, Kanina, Jericho (Orikumi), and reaching Butrint after numerous pillages. They joined the fleet that had previously conquered Corfu and attacked Dyrrachium from land and sea, devastating everything along the way. Under these harsh circumstances, the locals accepted the call of emperor Alexius I Comnenus to join forces with the Byzantines against the Normans. The Albanian forces could not take part in the ensuing battle because it had started before their arrival. Immediately before the battle, the Venetian fleet had secured a victory in the coast surrounding the city. Forced to retreat, Alexius ceded the command to a high Albanian official named Comiscortes in the service of Byzantium. The city's garrison resisted until February 1082, when Dyrrachium was betrayed to the Normans by the Venetian and Amalfitan merchants who had settled there. The Normans were now free to penetrate into the hinterland; they took Ioannina and some minor cities in southwestern Macedonia and Thessaly before appearing at the gates of Thessalonica.

Initially, Rome's immediate neighbours were either Latin towns and villages, or else tribal Sabines from the Apennine hills beyond. One by one Rome defeated both the persistent Sabines and the local cities, both those under Etruscan control and those that had cast off their Etruscan rulers. Rome defeated Latin cities in the Battle of Lake Regillus in 496 BC, the Battle of Mons Algidus in 458 BC, the Battle of Corbione in 446 BC, the Battle of Aricia, and especially the Battle of the Cremera in 477 BC wherein it fought against the most important Etruscan city of Veii.\n\nQuestion: What year did the Battle of Lake Regillus take place?\n\nAnswer:  496 BC\n\nTitle: Tucson,_Arizona\n\nBackground: Tracks include Tucson Raceway Park and Rillito Downs. Tucson Raceway Park hosts NASCAR-sanctioned auto racing events and is one of only two asphalt short tracks in Arizona. Rillito Downs is an in-town destination on weekends in January and February each year. This historic track held the first organized quarter horse races in the world, and they are still racing there. The racetrack is threatened by development. The Moltacqua racetrack, was another historic horse racetrack located on what is now Sabino Canyon Road and Vactor Ranch Trail, but it no longer exists.\n\nQuestion: What kind of races does Rillito Downs hold?\n\nAnswer:  quarter horse races\n\nTitle: Antarctica\n\nBackground: Antarctica is colder than the Arctic for three reasons. First, much of the continent is more than 3,000 m (9,800 ft) above sea level, and temperature decreases with elevation in the troposphere. Second, the Arctic Ocean covers the north polar zone: the ocean's relative warmth is transferred through the icepack and prevents temperatures in the Arctic regions from reaching the extremes typical of the land surface of Antarctica. Third, the Earth is at aphelion in July (i.e., the Earth is farthest from the Sun in the Antarctic winter), and the Earth is at perihelion in January (i.e., the Earth is closest to the Sun in the Antarctic summer). The orbital distance contributes to a colder Antarctic winter (and a warmer Antarctic summer) but the first two effects have more impact.\n\nQuestion: How high is the continent of Antarctica above sea level?\n\nAnswer:  3,000 m\n\nTitle: Communications_in_Somalia\n\nBackground: Broadband wireless services were offered by both dial up and non-dial up ISPs in major cities, such as Mogadishu, Bosaso, Hargeisa, Galkayo and Kismayo. Pricing ranged from $150 to $300 a month for unlimited internet access, with bandwidth rates of 64 kbit/s up and down. The main patrons of these wireless services were scholastic institutions, corporations, and UN, NGO and diplomatic missions. Mogadishu had the biggest subscriber base nationwide and was also the headquarters of the largest wireless internet services, among which were Dalkom (Wanaag HK), Orbit, Unitel and Webtel.\n\nQuestion: Who did not use the wireless services?\n\nAnswer:  unanswerable\n\nTitle: States_of_Germany\n\nBackground: Germany is a federal republic consisting of sixteen federal states (German: Bundesland, or Land).[a] Since today's Germany was formed from an earlier collection of several states, it has a federal constitution, and the constituent states retain a measure of sovereignty. With an emphasis on geographical conditions, Berlin and Hamburg are frequently called Stadtstaaten (city-states), as is the Free Hanseatic City of Bremen, which in fact includes the cities of Bremen and Bremerhaven. The remaining 13 states are called Fl\u00e4chenl\u00e4nder (literally: area states).\n\nQuestion: How many states are called \"Fl\u00e4chenl\u00e4nder\"?\n\nAnswer:  13\n\nTitle: Normans\n\nBackground: A few years after the First Crusade, in 1107, the Normans under the command of Bohemond, Robert's son, landed in Valona and besieged Dyrrachium using the most sophisticated military equipment of the time, but to no avail.

Rome defeated Latin cities in the Battle of Lake Regillus in 496 BC, the Battle of Mons Algidus in 458 BC, the Battle of Corbione in 446 BC, the Battle of Aricia, and especially the Battle of the Cremera in 477 BC wherein it fought against the most important Etruscan city of Veii.\n\nQuestion: What year did the Battle of Lake Regillus take place?\n\nAnswer:  496 BC\n\nTitle: Tucson,_Arizona\n\nBackground: Tracks include Tucson Raceway Park and Rillito Downs. Tucson Raceway Park hosts NASCAR-sanctioned auto racing events and is one of only two asphalt short tracks in Arizona. Rillito Downs is an in-town destination on weekends in January and February each year. This historic track held the first organized quarter horse races in the world, and they are still racing there. The racetrack is threatened by development. The Moltacqua racetrack, was another historic horse racetrack located on what is now Sabino Canyon Road and Vactor Ranch Trail, but it no longer exists.\n\nQuestion: What kind of races does Rillito Downs hold?\n\nAnswer:  quarter horse races\n\nTitle: Antarctica\n\nBackground: Antarctica is colder than the Arctic for three reasons. First, much of the continent is more than 3,000 m (9,800 ft) above sea level, and temperature decreases with elevation in the troposphere. Second, the Arctic Ocean covers the north polar zone: the ocean's relative warmth is transferred through the icepack and prevents temperatures in the Arctic regions from reaching the extremes typical of the land surface of Antarctica. Third, the Earth is at aphelion in July (i.e., the Earth is farthest from the Sun in the Antarctic winter), and the Earth is at perihelion in January (i.e., the Earth is closest to the Sun in the Antarctic summer). The orbital distance contributes to a colder Antarctic winter (and a warmer Antarctic summer) but the first two effects have more impact.\n\nQuestion: How high is the continent of Antarctica above sea level?\n\nAnswer:  3,000 m\n\nTitle: Communications_in_Somalia\n\nBackground: Broadband wireless services were offered by both dial up and non-dial up ISPs in major cities, such as Mogadishu, Bosaso, Hargeisa, Galkayo and Kismayo. Pricing ranged from $150 to $300 a month for unlimited internet access, with bandwidth rates of 64 kbit/s up and down. The main patrons of these wireless services were scholastic institutions, corporations, and UN, NGO and diplomatic missions. Mogadishu had the biggest subscriber base nationwide and was also the headquarters of the largest wireless internet services, among which were Dalkom (Wanaag HK), Orbit, Unitel and Webtel.\n\nQuestion: Who did not use the wireless services?\n\nAnswer:  unanswerable\n\nTitle: States_of_Germany\n\nBackground: Germany is a federal republic consisting of sixteen federal states (German: Bundesland, or Land).[a] Since today's Germany was formed from an earlier collection of several states, it has a federal constitution, and the constituent states retain a measure of sovereignty. With an emphasis on geographical conditions, Berlin and Hamburg are frequently called Stadtstaaten (city-states), as is the Free Hanseatic City of Bremen, which in fact includes the cities of Bremen and Bremerhaven. The remaining 13 states are called Fl\u00e4chenl\u00e4nder (literally: area states).\n\nQuestion: How many states are called \"Fl\u00e4chenl\u00e4nder\"?\n\nAnswer:  13\n\nTitle: Normans\n\nBackground: A few years after the First Crusade, in 1107, the Normans under the command of Bohemond, Robert's son, landed in Valona and besieged Dyrrachium using the most sophisticated military equipment of the time, but to no avail. Meanwhile, they occupied Petrela, the citadel of Mili at the banks of the river Deabolis, Gllavenica (Ballsh), Kanina and Jericho. This time, the Albanians sided with the Normans, dissatisfied by the heavy taxes the Byzantines had imposed upon them. With their help, the Normans secured the Arbanon passes and opened their way to Dibra. The lack of supplies, disease and Byzantine resistance forced Bohemond to retreat from his campaign and sign a peace treaty with the Byzantines in the city of Deabolis.\n\nQuestion: What river was Petrela located by?\n\nAnswer:", " unanswerable"]], "resps": [["  the Deabolis river"], [[-14.953125, false]]], "filtered_resps": ["  the Deabolis river", [-14.953125, false]], "filter": "none", "metrics": ["exact", "f1", "HasAns_exact", "HasAns_f1", "NoAns_exact", "NoAns_f1", "best_exact", "best_f1"], "doc_hash": "7d6353f89fe31d49059063abae5a7646be54a4ef12901116c17e146befef9a1e", "prompt_hash": "2bf087b0c4df912d7ed8ec722443826af4af4a0c02ddbe7ec8c461b670dc6a55", "target_hash": "0addc6f4642b44e1c19006907e7b8e22d004bf1c73d2aa79240ad869111367eb", "exact": [{"id": "56de15104396321400ee25b9", "prediction_text": "  the Deabolis river", "no_answer_probability": 3.2058287938192153e-07}, {"id": "56de15104396321400ee25b9", "answers": {"text": ["Deabolis", "the river Deabolis", "Deabolis"], "answer_start": [302, 292, 302]}}], "f1": [{"id": "56de15104396321400ee25b9", "prediction_text": "  the Deabolis river", "no_answer_probability": 3.2058287938192153e-07}, {"id": "56de15104396321400ee25b9", "answers": {"text": ["Deabolis", "the river Deabolis", "Deabolis"], "answer_start": [302, 292, 302]}}], "HasAns_exact": [{"id": "56de15104396321400ee25b9", "prediction_text": "  the Deabolis river", "no_answer_probability": 3.2058287938192153e-07}, {"id": "56de15104396321400ee25b9", "answers": {"text": ["Deabolis", "the river Deabolis", "Deabolis"], "answer_start": [302, 292, 302]}}], "HasAns_f1": [{"id": "56de15104396321400ee25b9", "prediction_text": "  the Deabolis river", "no_answer_probability": 3.2058287938192153e-07}, {"id": "56de15104396321400ee25b9", "answers": {"text": ["Deabolis", "the river Deabolis", "Deabolis"], "answer_start": [302, 292, 302]}}], "NoAns_exact": [{"id": "56de15104396321400ee25b9", "prediction_text": "  the Deabolis river", "no_answer_probability": 3.2058287938192153e-07}, {"id": "56de15104396321400ee25b9", "answers": {"text": ["Deabolis", "the river Deabolis", "Deabolis"], "answer_start": [302, 292, 302]}}], "NoAns_f1": [{"id": "56de15104396321400ee25b9", "prediction_text": "  the Deabolis river", "no_answer_probability": 3.2058287938192153e-07}, {"id": "56de15104396321400ee25b9", "answers": {"text": ["Deabolis", "the river Deabolis", "Deabolis"], "answer_start": [302, 292, 302]}}], "best_exact": [{"id": "56de15104396321400ee25b9", "prediction_text": "  the Deabolis river", "no_answer_probability": 3.2058287938192153e-07}, {"id": "56de15104396321400ee25b9", "answers": {"text": ["Deabolis", "the river Deabolis", "Deabolis"], "answer_start": [302, 292, 302]}}], "best_f1": [{"id": "56de15104396321400ee25b9", "prediction_text": "  the Deabolis river", "no_answer_probability": 3.2058287938192153e-07}, {"id": "56de15104396321400ee25b9", "answers": {"text": ["Deabolis", "the river Deabolis", "Deabolis"], "answer_start": [302, 292, 302]}}]}, {"doc_id": 73, "doc": {"id": "5ad3ee2d604f3c001a3ff7e1", "title": "Normans", "context": "A few years after the First Crusade, in 1107, the Normans under the command of Bohemond, Robert's son, landed in Valona and besieged Dyrrachium using the most sophisticated military equipment of the time, but to no avail.

The asphalt/bitumen in the removed material can be reactivated and put back to use in new pavement mixes. With some 95% of paved roads being constructed of or surfaced with asphalt, a substantial amount of asphalt pavement material is reclaimed each year. According to industry surveys conducted annually by the Federal Highway Administration and the National Asphalt Pavement Association, more than 99% of the asphalt removed each year from road surfaces during widening and resurfacing projects is reused as part of new pavements, roadbeds, shoulders and embankments.\n\nQuestion: During what action is asphalt often reclaimed?\n\nAnswer:  maintenance\n\nTitle: Symbiosis\n\nBackground: A further example is the goby fish, which sometimes lives together with a shrimp. The shrimp digs and cleans up a burrow in the sand in which both the shrimp and the goby fish live. The shrimp is almost blind, leaving it vulnerable to predators when outside its burrow. In case of danger the goby fish touches the shrimp with its tail to warn it. When that happens both the shrimp and goby fish quickly retreat into the burrow.

Others complied. Some local communities were not only pre-dominantly Christian, but powerful and influential; and some provincial authorities were lenient, notably the Caesar in Gaul, Constantius Chlorus, the father of Constantine I.

During the Second Civil War, leadership of the Umayyad clan shifted from the Sufyanid branch of the family to the Marwanid branch. As the constant campaigning exhausted the resources and manpower of the state, the Umayyads, weakened by the Third Muslim Civil War of 744\u2013747 CE, were finally toppled by the Abbasid Revolution in 750 CE/132 AH. A branch of the family fled across North Africa to Al-Andalus, where they established the Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba, which lasted until 1031 before falling due to the Fitna of al-\u00c1ndalus.\n\nQuestion: In what year CE did the Second Muslim Civil War end?\n\nAnswer:  692\n\nTitle: Education\n\nBackground: Secondary education in the United States did not emerge until 1910, with the rise of large corporations and advancing technology in factories, which required skilled workers. In order to meet this new job demand, high schools were created, with a curriculum focused on practical job skills that would better prepare students for white collar or skilled blue collar work. This proved beneficial for both employers and employees, since the improved human capital lowered costs for the employer, while skilled employees received a higher wages.\n\nQuestion: What emerged in 1912?\n\nAnswer:  unanswerable\n\nTitle: Armenia\n\nBackground: Agriculture accounted for less than 20% of both net material product and total employment before the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. After independence, the importance of agriculture in the economy increased markedly, its share at the end of the 1990s rising to more than 30% of GDP and more than 40% of total employment. This increase in the importance of agriculture was attributable to food security needs of the population in the face of uncertainty during the first phases of transition and the collapse of the non-agricultural sectors of the economy in the early 1990s. As the economic situation stabilized and growth resumed, the share of agriculture in GDP dropped to slightly over 20% (2006 data), although the share of agriculture in employment remained more than 40%.\n\nQuestion: Was agriculture more important before or after Armenia left the Soviet Union?\n\nAnswer:  After\n\nTitle: Normans\n\nBackground: A few years after the First Crusade, in 1107, the Normans under the command of Bohemond, Robert's son, landed in Valona and besieged Dyrrachium using the most sophisticated military equipment of the time, but to no avail. Meanwhile, they occupied Petrela, the citadel of Mili at the banks of the river Deabolis, Gllavenica (Ballsh), Kanina and Jericho. This time, the Albanians sided with the Normans, dissatisfied by the heavy taxes the Byzantines had imposed upon them. With their help, the Normans secured the Arbanon passes and opened their way to Dibra. The lack of supplies, disease and Byzantine resistance forced Bohemond to retreat from his campaign and sign a peace treaty with the Byzantines in the city of Deabolis.\n\nQuestion: Who did Robert lead agains Dyrrachium in 1107?\n\nAnswer:", {"until": ["\n"]}], ["Title: Asphalt\n\nBackground: When maintenance is performed on asphalt pavements, such as milling to remove a worn or damaged surface, the removed material can be returned to a facility for processing into new pavement mixtures. The asphalt/bitumen in the removed material can be reactivated and put back to use in new pavement mixes. With some 95% of paved roads being constructed of or surfaced with asphalt, a substantial amount of asphalt pavement material is reclaimed each year. According to industry surveys conducted annually by the Federal Highway Administration and the National Asphalt Pavement Association, more than 99% of the asphalt removed each year from road surfaces during widening and resurfacing projects is reused as part of new pavements, roadbeds, shoulders and embankments.\n\nQuestion: During what action is asphalt often reclaimed?\n\nAnswer:  maintenance\n\nTitle: Symbiosis\n\nBackground: A further example is the goby fish, which sometimes lives together with a shrimp. The shrimp digs and cleans up a burrow in the sand in which both the shrimp and the goby fish live. The shrimp is almost blind, leaving it vulnerable to predators when outside its burrow. In case of danger the goby fish touches the shrimp with its tail to warn it. When that happens both the shrimp and goby fish quickly retreat into the burrow. Different species of gobies (Elacatinus spp.) also exhibit mutualistic behavior through cleaning up ectoparasites in other fish.\n\nQuestion: What species does this shrimp have a relationship with?\n\nAnswer:  the goby fish\n\nTitle: Religion_in_ancient_Rome\n\nBackground: In some cases and in some places the edicts were strictly enforced: some Christians resisted and were imprisoned or martyred. Others complied. Some local communities were not only pre-dominantly Christian, but powerful and influential; and some provincial authorities were lenient, notably the Caesar in Gaul, Constantius Chlorus, the father of Constantine I. Diocletian's successor Galerius maintained anti-Christian policy until his deathbed revocation in 311, when he asked Christians to pray for him. \"This meant an of\ufb01cial recognition of their importance in the religious world of the Roman empire, although one of the tetrarchs, Maximinus Daia, still oppressed Christians in his part of the empire up to 313.\"\n\nQuestion: How were the Roman edicts handled in some areas?\n\nAnswer:  strictly enforced\n\nTitle: Umayyad_Caliphate\n\nBackground: The rivalries between the Arab tribes had caused unrest in the provinces outside Syria, most notably in the Second Muslim Civil War of 680\u2013692 CE and the Berber Revolt of 740\u2013743 CE.

The airport records an average of 7 days of hail and 11 days of snow or sleet a year; though it only records lying snow for 2 days of the year. The low altitude of the city, and moderating influences of the harbour, mean that lying snow very rarely occurs in the city itself. There are on average 204 \"rainy\" days a year (over 0.2 millimetres (0.0079 in) of rainfall), of which there are 73 days with \"heavy rain\" (over 5 millimetres (0.20 in)). Cork is also a generally foggy city, with an average of 97 days of fog a year, most common during mornings and during winter.

Along with the energy and awareness created by the day's hit sensation, a wave of Italian mandolinists travelled Europe in the 1880s and 1890s and in the United States by the mid-1880s, playing and teaching their instrument. The instrument's popularity continued to increase during the 1890s and mandolin popularity was at its height in \"early years of the 20th century.\" Thousands were taking up the instrument as a pastime, and it became an instrument of society, taken up by young men and women.

The two sports have shared origins and are closely related but have significant differences. In particular, Canadian football has 12 players on the field per team rather than 11; the field is roughly 10 yards wider, and 10 yards longer between end-zones that are themselves 10 yards deeper; and a team has only three downs to gain 10 yards, which results in less offensive rushing than in the American game. In the Canadian game all players on the defending team, when a down begins, must be at least 1 yard from the line of scrimmage.

Disraeli's expansionist foreign policy, which Victoria endorsed, led to conflicts such as the Anglo-Zulu War and the Second Anglo-Afghan War. \"If we are to maintain our position as a first-rate Power\", she wrote, \"we must ... be Prepared for attacks and wars, somewhere or other, CONTINUALLY.\" Victoria saw the expansion of the British Empire as civilising and benign, protecting native peoples from more aggressive powers or cruel rulers: \"It is not in our custom to annexe countries\", she said, \"unless we are obliged & forced to do so.\" To Victoria's dismay, Disraeli lost the 1880 general election, and Gladstone returned as prime minister. When Disraeli died the following year, she was blinded by \"fast falling tears\", and erected a memorial tablet \"placed by his grateful Sovereign and Friend, Victoria R.I.\"\n\nQuestion: What impact did Victorias threats have on the impact of the Russo=Turkish war?\n\nAnswer:  no impact\n\nTitle: Gramophone_record\n\nBackground: As the playing of gramophone records causes gradual degradation of the recording, they are best preserved by transferring them onto other media and playing the records as rarely as possible.

Ennius translated the work of Graeco-Sicilian Euhemerus, who explained the genesis of the gods as apotheosized mortals. In the last century of the Republic, Epicurean and particularly Stoic interpretations were a preoccupation of the literate elite, most of whom held - or had held - high office and traditional Roman priesthoods; notably, Scaevola and the polymath Varro. For Varro - well versed in Euhemerus' theory - popular religious observance was based on a necessary fiction; what the people believed was not itself the truth, but their observance led them to as much higher truth as their limited capacity could deal with. Whereas in popular belief deities held power over mortal lives, the skeptic might say that mortal devotion had made gods of mortals, and these same gods were only sustained by devotion and cult.\n\nQuestion: What theory claims that popular belief was based on fiction?\n\nAnswer:  Euhemerus' theory\n\nTitle: Sexual_orientation\n\nBackground: These studies suggest that men and women are different in terms of sexual arousal patterns and that this is also reflected in how their genitals react to sexual stimuli of both genders or even to non-human stimuli. Sexual orientation has many dimensions (attractions, behavior, identity), of which sexual arousal is the only product of sexual attractions which can be measured at present with some degree of physical precision. Thus, the fact that women are aroused by seeing non-human primates having sex does not mean that women's sexual orientation includes this type of sexual interest. Some researchers argue that women's sexual orientation depends less on their patterns of sexual arousal than men's and that other components of sexual orientation (like emotional attachment) must be taken into account when describing women's sexual orientations. In contrast, men's sexual orientations tend to be primarily focused on the physical component of attractions and, thus, their sexual feelings are more exclusively oriented according to sex.\n\nQuestion: What do researches believe must be taken into account for women in these studies?\n\nAnswer:  emotional attachment\n\nTitle: National_Archives_and_Records_Administration\n\nBackground: The National Historical Publications and Records Commission (NHPRC)\u2014the agency's grant-making arm\u2014awards funds to state and local governments, public and private archives, colleges and universities, and other nonprofit organizations to preserve and publish historical records. Since 1964, the NHPRC has awarded some 4,500 grants.\n\nQuestion: What do many nonprofit organizations take part in to support students?\n\nAnswer:  unanswerable\n\nTitle: Yale_University\n\nBackground: Many of Yale's buildings were constructed in the Collegiate Gothic architecture style from 1917 to 1931, financed largely by Edward S. Harkness Stone sculpture built into the walls of the buildings portray contemporary college personalities such as a writer, an athlete, a tea-drinking socialite, and a student who has fallen asleep while reading. Similarly, the decorative friezes on the buildings depict contemporary scenes such as policemen chasing a robber and arresting a prostitute (on the wall of the Law School), or a student relaxing with a mug of beer and a cigarette. The architect, James Gamble Rogers, faux-aged these buildings by splashing the walls with acid, deliberately breaking their leaded glass windows and repairing them in the style of the Middle Ages, and creating niches for decorative statuary but leaving them empty to simulate loss or theft over the ages. In fact, the buildings merely simulate Middle Ages architecture, for though they appear to be constructed of solid stone blocks in the authentic manner, most actually have steel framing as was commonly used in 1930. One exception is Harkness Tower, 216 feet (66 m) tall, which was originally a free-standing stone structure. It was reinforced in 1964 to allow the installation of the Yale Memorial Carillon.\n\nQuestion: Who financed a large chunk of the architecture from 1917 to 1931\n\nAnswer:  Edward S. Harkness\n\nTitle: War_on_Terror\n\nBackground: In a 'Letter to American People' written by Osama bin Laden in 2002, he stated that one of the reasons he was fighting America is because of its support of India on the Kashmir issue. While on a trip to Delhi in 2002, U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld suggested that Al-Qaeda was active in Kashmir, though he did not have any hard evidence. An investigation in 2002 unearthed evidence that Al-Qaeda and its affiliates were prospering in Pakistan-administered Kashmir with tacit approval of Pakistan's National Intelligence agency Inter-Services Intelligence. A team of Special Air Service and Delta Force was sent into Indian-administered Kashmir in 2002 to hunt for Osama bin Laden after reports that he was being sheltered by the Kashmiri militant group Harkat-ul-Mujahideen. U.S. officials believed that Al-Qaeda was helping organize a campaign of terror in Kashmir in order to provoke conflict between India and Pakistan. Fazlur Rehman Khalil, the leader of the Harkat-ul-Mujahideen, signed al-Qaeda's 1998 declaration of holy war, which called on Muslims to attack all Americans and their allies. Indian sources claimed that In 2006, Al-Qaeda claimed they had established a wing in Kashmir; this worried the Indian government. India also claimed that Al-Qaeda has strong ties with the Kashmir militant groups Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed in Pakistan. While on a visit to Pakistan in January 2010, U.S. Defense secretary Robert Gates stated that Al-Qaeda was seeking to destabilize the region and planning to provoke a nuclear war between India and Pakistan.\n\nQuestion: Who led the Harkat-ul-Mujahideen?\n\nAnswer:  Fazlur Rehman Khalil\n\nTitle: Normans\n\nBackground: The further decline of Byzantine state-of-affairs paved the road to a third attack in 1185, when a large Norman army invaded Dyrrachium, owing to the betrayal of high Byzantine officials.

For Varro - well versed in Euhemerus' theory - popular religious observance was based on a necessary fiction; what the people believed was not itself the truth, but their observance led them to as much higher truth as their limited capacity could deal with. Whereas in popular belief deities held power over mortal lives, the skeptic might say that mortal devotion had made gods of mortals, and these same gods were only sustained by devotion and cult.\n\nQuestion: What theory claims that popular belief was based on fiction?\n\nAnswer:  Euhemerus' theory\n\nTitle: Sexual_orientation\n\nBackground: These studies suggest that men and women are different in terms of sexual arousal patterns and that this is also reflected in how their genitals react to sexual stimuli of both genders or even to non-human stimuli. Sexual orientation has many dimensions (attractions, behavior, identity), of which sexual arousal is the only product of sexual attractions which can be measured at present with some degree of physical precision. Thus, the fact that women are aroused by seeing non-human primates having sex does not mean that women's sexual orientation includes this type of sexual interest. Some researchers argue that women's sexual orientation depends less on their patterns of sexual arousal than men's and that other components of sexual orientation (like emotional attachment) must be taken into account when describing women's sexual orientations. In contrast, men's sexual orientations tend to be primarily focused on the physical component of attractions and, thus, their sexual feelings are more exclusively oriented according to sex.\n\nQuestion: What do researches believe must be taken into account for women in these studies?\n\nAnswer:  emotional attachment\n\nTitle: National_Archives_and_Records_Administration\n\nBackground: The National Historical Publications and Records Commission (NHPRC)\u2014the agency's grant-making arm\u2014awards funds to state and local governments, public and private archives, colleges and universities, and other nonprofit organizations to preserve and publish historical records. Since 1964, the NHPRC has awarded some 4,500 grants.\n\nQuestion: What do many nonprofit organizations take part in to support students?\n\nAnswer:  unanswerable\n\nTitle: Yale_University\n\nBackground: Many of Yale's buildings were constructed in the Collegiate Gothic architecture style from 1917 to 1931, financed largely by Edward S. Harkness Stone sculpture built into the walls of the buildings portray contemporary college personalities such as a writer, an athlete, a tea-drinking socialite, and a student who has fallen asleep while reading. Similarly, the decorative friezes on the buildings depict contemporary scenes such as policemen chasing a robber and arresting a prostitute (on the wall of the Law School), or a student relaxing with a mug of beer and a cigarette. The architect, James Gamble Rogers, faux-aged these buildings by splashing the walls with acid, deliberately breaking their leaded glass windows and repairing them in the style of the Middle Ages, and creating niches for decorative statuary but leaving them empty to simulate loss or theft over the ages. In fact, the buildings merely simulate Middle Ages architecture, for though they appear to be constructed of solid stone blocks in the authentic manner, most actually have steel framing as was commonly used in 1930. One exception is Harkness Tower, 216 feet (66 m) tall, which was originally a free-standing stone structure. It was reinforced in 1964 to allow the installation of the Yale Memorial Carillon.\n\nQuestion: Who financed a large chunk of the architecture from 1917 to 1931\n\nAnswer:  Edward S. Harkness\n\nTitle: War_on_Terror\n\nBackground: In a 'Letter to American People' written by Osama bin Laden in 2002, he stated that one of the reasons he was fighting America is because of its support of India on the Kashmir issue. While on a trip to Delhi in 2002, U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld suggested that Al-Qaeda was active in Kashmir, though he did not have any hard evidence. An investigation in 2002 unearthed evidence that Al-Qaeda and its affiliates were prospering in Pakistan-administered Kashmir with tacit approval of Pakistan's National Intelligence agency Inter-Services Intelligence. A team of Special Air Service and Delta Force was sent into Indian-administered Kashmir in 2002 to hunt for Osama bin Laden after reports that he was being sheltered by the Kashmiri militant group Harkat-ul-Mujahideen. U.S. officials believed that Al-Qaeda was helping organize a campaign of terror in Kashmir in order to provoke conflict between India and Pakistan. Fazlur Rehman Khalil, the leader of the Harkat-ul-Mujahideen, signed al-Qaeda's 1998 declaration of holy war, which called on Muslims to attack all Americans and their allies. Indian sources claimed that In 2006, Al-Qaeda claimed they had established a wing in Kashmir; this worried the Indian government. India also claimed that Al-Qaeda has strong ties with the Kashmir militant groups Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed in Pakistan. While on a visit to Pakistan in January 2010, U.S. Defense secretary Robert Gates stated that Al-Qaeda was seeking to destabilize the region and planning to provoke a nuclear war between India and Pakistan.\n\nQuestion: Who led the Harkat-ul-Mujahideen?\n\nAnswer:  Fazlur Rehman Khalil\n\nTitle: Normans\n\nBackground: The further decline of Byzantine state-of-affairs paved the road to a third attack in 1185, when a large Norman army invaded Dyrrachium, owing to the betrayal of high Byzantine officials.

Examples include Chuquicamata in Chile, Bingham Canyon Mine in Utah, United States and El Chino Mine in New Mexico, United States. According to the British Geological Survey, in 2005, Chile was the top mine producer of copper with at least one-third world share followed by the United States, Indonesia and Peru. Copper can also be recovered through the in-situ leach process. Several sites in the state of Arizona are considered prime candidates for this method. The amount of copper in use is increasing and the quantity available is barely sufficient to allow all countries to reach developed world levels of usage.\n\nQuestion: What is the name of the process being considered in Australia that allows copper to be recovered?\n\nAnswer:  unanswerable\n\nTitle: Insect\n\nBackground: Insect respiration is accomplished without lungs. Instead, the insect respiratory system uses a system of internal tubes and sacs through which gases either diffuse or are actively pumped, delivering oxygen directly to tissues that need it via their trachea (element 8 in numbered diagram). Since oxygen is delivered directly, the circulatory system is not used to carry oxygen, and is therefore greatly reduced. The insect circulatory system has no veins or arteries, and instead consists of little more than a single, perforated dorsal tube which pulses peristaltically. Toward the thorax, the dorsal tube (element 14) divides into chambers and acts like the insect's heart. The opposite end of the dorsal tube is like the aorta of the insect circulating the hemolymph, arthropods' fluid analog of blood, inside the body cavity.:61\u201365 Air is taken in through openings on the sides of the abdomen called spiracles.\n\nQuestion: What gets delivered to tissues in an insect's respiratory system?\n\nAnswer:  oxygen\n\nTitle: Infection\n\nBackground: Because it is normal to have bacterial colonization, it is difficult to know which chronic wounds are infected. Despite the huge number of wounds seen in clinical practice, there are limited quality data for evaluated symptoms and signs. A review of chronic wounds in the Journal of the American Medical Association's \"Rational Clinical Examination Series\" quantified the importance of increased pain as an indicator of infection. The review showed that the most useful finding is an increase in the level of pain [likelihood ratio (LR) range, 11-20] makes infection much more likely, but the absence of pain (negative likelihood ratio range, 0.64-0.88) does not rule out infection (summary LR 0.64-0.88).\n\nQuestion: Why is it easy to know which chronic wounds are infected?\n\nAnswer:  unanswerable\n\nTitle: Charleston,_South_Carolina\n\nBackground: According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 127.5 square miles (330.2 km2), of which 109.0 square miles (282.2 km2) is land and 18.5 square miles (47.9 km2) is covered by water. The old city is located on a peninsula at the point where, as Charlestonians say, \"The Ashley and the Cooper Rivers come together to form the Atlantic Ocean.\" The entire peninsula is very low, some is landfill material, and as such, frequently floods during heavy rains, storm surges, and unusually high tides. The city limits have expanded across the Ashley River from the peninsula, encompassing the majority of West Ashley as well as James Island and some of Johns Island. The city limits also have expanded across the Cooper River, encompassing Daniel Island and the Cainhoy area.

The first has to do with coordinating units of length with certain physical objects. This is motivated by the fact that we can never directly apprehend length. Instead we must choose some physical object, say the Standard Metre at the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (International Bureau of Weights and Measures), or the wavelength of cadmium to stand in as our unit of length. The second feature deals with separated objects. Although we can, presumably, directly test the equality of length of two measuring rods when they are next to one another, we can not find out as much for two rods distant from one another. Even supposing that two rods, whenever brought near to one another are seen to be equal in length, we are not justified in stating that they are always equal in length. This impossibility undermines our ability to decide the equality of length of two distant objects. Sameness of length, to the contrary, must be set by definition.\n\nQuestion: The first feature of Coordinative definition involves what?\n\nAnswer:  coordinating units of length with certain physical objects\n\nTitle: Seattle\n\nBackground: Seattle annually sends a team of spoken word slammers to the National Poetry Slam and considers itself home to such performance poets as Buddy Wakefield, two-time Individual World Poetry Slam Champ; Anis Mojgani, two-time National Poetry Slam Champ; and Danny Sherrard, 2007 National Poetry Slam Champ and 2008 Individual World Poetry Slam Champ. Seattle also hosted the 2001 national Poetry Slam Tournament.

These boxed set releases are of films by notable actors, directors or studios that were previously unreleased on DVD or VHS. The sets often include bonus discs including documentaries and shorts from the TCM library. The initial batch of DVDs are printed in limited quantities and subsequent batches are made-on-demand (MOD).\n\nQuestion: Through what company is the TCM Vault Collection released?\n\nAnswer:  Warner Home Video\n\nTitle: Umayyad_Caliphate\n\nBackground: Many Muslims criticized the Umayyads for having too many non-Muslim, former Roman administrators in their government. St John of Damascus was also a high administrator in the Umayyad administration. As the Muslims took over cities, they left the peoples political representatives and the Roman tax collectors and the administrators. The taxes to the central government were calculated and negotiated by the peoples political representatives. The Central government got paid for the services it provided and the local government got the money for the services it provided. Many Christian cities also used some of the taxes on maintain their churches and run their own organizations. Later the Umayyads were criticized by some Muslims for not reducing the taxes of the people who converted to Islam. These new converts continues to pay the same taxes that were previously negotiated.\n\nQuestion: In addition to criticism received for employing non-Muslims, for what notable reason did some Muslims criticize the Umayyads?\n\nAnswer:  not reducing the taxes of the people who converted to Islam\n\nTitle: Greece\n\nBackground: Lack of political unity within Greece resulted in frequent conflict between Greek states. The most devastating intra-Greek war was the Peloponnesian War (431\u2013404 BC), won by Sparta and marking the demise of the Athenian Empire as the leading power in ancient Greece. Both Athens and Sparta were later overshadowed by Thebes and eventually Macedon, with the latter uniting the Greek world in the League of Corinth (also known as the Hellenic League or Greek League) under the guidance of Phillip II, who was elected leader of the first unified Greek state in history.\n\nQuestion: Who was the first leader of a unified Greece?\n\nAnswer:  Phillip II\n\nTitle: Southampton\n\nBackground: Other major employers in the city include Ordnance Survey, the UK's national mapping agency, whose headquarters is located in a new building on the outskirts of the city, opened in February 2011. The Lloyd's Register Group has announced plans to move its London marine operations to a specially developed site at the University of Southampton. The area of Swaythling is home to Ford's Southampton Assembly Plant, where the majority of their Transit models are manufactured. Closure of the plant in 2013 was announced in 2012, with the loss of hundreds of jobs.\n\nQuestion: What area of Southampton holds a Ford assembly plant?\n\nAnswer:  Swaythling\n\nTitle: Normans\n\nBackground: The further decline of Byzantine state-of-affairs paved the road to a third attack in 1185, when a large Norman army invaded Dyrrachium, owing to the betrayal of high Byzantine officials. Some time later, Dyrrachium\u2014one of the most important naval bases of the Adriatic\u2014fell again to Byzantine hands.\n\nQuestion: What naval base fell to the Normans?\n\nAnswer:", {"until": ["\n"]}], ["Title: Philosophy_of_space_and_time\n\nBackground: Coordinative definition has two major features. The first has to do with coordinating units of length with certain physical objects. This is motivated by the fact that we can never directly apprehend length. Instead we must choose some physical object, say the Standard Metre at the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (International Bureau of Weights and Measures), or the wavelength of cadmium to stand in as our unit of length. The second feature deals with separated objects. Although we can, presumably, directly test the equality of length of two measuring rods when they are next to one another, we can not find out as much for two rods distant from one another. Even supposing that two rods, whenever brought near to one another are seen to be equal in length, we are not justified in stating that they are always equal in length. This impossibility undermines our ability to decide the equality of length of two distant objects. Sameness of length, to the contrary, must be set by definition.\n\nQuestion: The first feature of Coordinative definition involves what?\n\nAnswer:  coordinating units of length with certain physical objects\n\nTitle: Seattle\n\nBackground: Seattle annually sends a team of spoken word slammers to the National Poetry Slam and considers itself home to such performance poets as Buddy Wakefield, two-time Individual World Poetry Slam Champ; Anis Mojgani, two-time National Poetry Slam Champ; and Danny Sherrard, 2007 National Poetry Slam Champ and 2008 Individual World Poetry Slam Champ. Seattle also hosted the 2001 national Poetry Slam Tournament. The Seattle Poetry Festival is a biennial poetry festival that (launched first as the Poetry Circus in 1997) has featured local, regional, national, and international names in poetry.\n\nQuestion: How often is the Seattle Poetry festival held?\n\nAnswer:  biennial\n\nTitle: Turner_Classic_Movies\n\nBackground: The TCM Vault Collection consists of several different DVD collections of rare classic films that have been licensed, remastered and released by Turner Classic Movies (through corporate sister Warner Home Video). These boxed set releases are of films by notable actors, directors or studios that were previously unreleased on DVD or VHS. The sets often include bonus discs including documentaries and shorts from the TCM library. The initial batch of DVDs are printed in limited quantities and subsequent batches are made-on-demand (MOD).\n\nQuestion: Through what company is the TCM Vault Collection released?\n\nAnswer:  Warner Home Video\n\nTitle: Umayyad_Caliphate\n\nBackground: Many Muslims criticized the Umayyads for having too many non-Muslim, former Roman administrators in their government. St John of Damascus was also a high administrator in the Umayyad administration. As the Muslims took over cities, they left the peoples political representatives and the Roman tax collectors and the administrators. The taxes to the central government were calculated and negotiated by the peoples political representatives. The Central government got paid for the services it provided and the local government got the money for the services it provided. Many Christian cities also used some of the taxes on maintain their churches and run their own organizations. Later the Umayyads were criticized by some Muslims for not reducing the taxes of the people who converted to Islam. These new converts continues to pay the same taxes that were previously negotiated.\n\nQuestion: In addition to criticism received for employing non-Muslims, for what notable reason did some Muslims criticize the Umayyads?\n\nAnswer:  not reducing the taxes of the people who converted to Islam\n\nTitle: Greece\n\nBackground: Lack of political unity within Greece resulted in frequent conflict between Greek states. The most devastating intra-Greek war was the Peloponnesian War (431\u2013404 BC), won by Sparta and marking the demise of the Athenian Empire as the leading power in ancient Greece.

Cork City Council has 31 elected members representing six electoral wards. The members are affiliated to the following political parties: Fine Gael (5 members), Fianna F\u00e1il (10 members), Sinn F\u00e9in (8 members), Anti-Austerity Alliance (3 members), Workers' Party (1 member), Independents (4 members). Certain councillors are co-opted to represent the city at the South-West Regional Authority. A new Lord Mayor of Cork is chosen in a vote by the elected members of the council under a D'Hondt system count.\n\nQuestion: Who has 31 appointed members?\n\nAnswer:  unanswerable\n\nTitle: Culture\n\nBackground: Although anthropologists worldwide refer to Tylor's definition of culture, in the 20th century \"culture\" emerged as the central and unifying concept of American anthropology, where it most commonly refers to the universal human capacity to classify and encode human experiences symbolically, and to communicate symbolically encoded experiences socially.[citation needed] American anthropology is organized into four fields, each of which plays an important role in research on culture: biological anthropology, linguistic anthropology, cultural anthropology, and archaeology.\n\nQuestion: Which century had \"culture\" as a secondary concept of European anthropology emerge?\n\nAnswer:  unanswerable\n\nTitle: History_of_science\n\nBackground: An ancient Indian treatise on statecraft, economic policy and military strategy by Kautilya and Vi\u1e63h\u1e47ugupta, who are traditionally identified with Ch\u0101\u1e47akya (c. 350\u2013-283 BCE). In this treatise, the behaviors and relationships of the people, the King, the State, the Government Superintendents, Courtiers, Enemies, Invaders, and Corporations are analysed and documented. Roger Boesche describes the Artha\u015b\u0101stra as \"a book of political realism, a book analysing how the political world does work and not very often stating how it ought to work, a book that frequently discloses to a king what calculating and sometimes brutal measures he must carry out to preserve the state and the common good.\"\n\nQuestion: When was Chanakya alive?\n\nAnswer:  350\u2013-283 BCE\n\nTitle: Energy\n\nBackground: Some types of energy are a varying mix of both potential and kinetic energy. An example is mechanical energy which is the sum of (usually macroscopic) kinetic and potential energy in a system. Elastic energy in materials is also dependent upon electrical potential energy (among atoms and molecules), as is chemical energy, which is stored and released from a reservoir of electrical potential energy between electrons, and the molecules or atomic nuclei that attract them.[need quotation to verify].The list is also not necessarily complete. Whenever physical scientists discover that a certain phenomenon appears to violate the law of energy conservation, new forms are typically added that account for the discrepancy.\n\nQuestion: What is dependent upon electrical potential energy?\n\nAnswer:  Elastic energy in materials\n\nTitle: Paper\n\nBackground: Paper made from wood pulp is not necessarily less durable than a rag paper. The ageing behavior of a paper is determined by its manufacture, not the original source of the fibres.

Cork City Council has 31 elected members representing six electoral wards. The members are affiliated to the following political parties: Fine Gael (5 members), Fianna F\u00e1il (10 members), Sinn F\u00e9in (8 members), Anti-Austerity Alliance (3 members), Workers' Party (1 member), Independents (4 members). Certain councillors are co-opted to represent the city at the South-West Regional Authority. A new Lord Mayor of Cork is chosen in a vote by the elected members of the council under a D'Hondt system count.\n\nQuestion: Who has 31 appointed members?\n\nAnswer:  unanswerable\n\nTitle: Culture\n\nBackground: Although anthropologists worldwide refer to Tylor's definition of culture, in the 20th century \"culture\" emerged as the central and unifying concept of American anthropology, where it most commonly refers to the universal human capacity to classify and encode human experiences symbolically, and to communicate symbolically encoded experiences socially.[citation needed] American anthropology is organized into four fields, each of which plays an important role in research on culture: biological anthropology, linguistic anthropology, cultural anthropology, and archaeology.\n\nQuestion: Which century had \"culture\" as a secondary concept of European anthropology emerge?\n\nAnswer:  unanswerable\n\nTitle: History_of_science\n\nBackground: An ancient Indian treatise on statecraft, economic policy and military strategy by Kautilya and Vi\u1e63h\u1e47ugupta, who are traditionally identified with Ch\u0101\u1e47akya (c. 350\u2013-283 BCE). In this treatise, the behaviors and relationships of the people, the King, the State, the Government Superintendents, Courtiers, Enemies, Invaders, and Corporations are analysed and documented. Roger Boesche describes the Artha\u015b\u0101stra as \"a book of political realism, a book analysing how the political world does work and not very often stating how it ought to work, a book that frequently discloses to a king what calculating and sometimes brutal measures he must carry out to preserve the state and the common good.\"\n\nQuestion: When was Chanakya alive?\n\nAnswer:  350\u2013-283 BCE\n\nTitle: Energy\n\nBackground: Some types of energy are a varying mix of both potential and kinetic energy. An example is mechanical energy which is the sum of (usually macroscopic) kinetic and potential energy in a system. Elastic energy in materials is also dependent upon electrical potential energy (among atoms and molecules), as is chemical energy, which is stored and released from a reservoir of electrical potential energy between electrons, and the molecules or atomic nuclei that attract them.[need quotation to verify].The list is also not necessarily complete. Whenever physical scientists discover that a certain phenomenon appears to violate the law of energy conservation, new forms are typically added that account for the discrepancy.\n\nQuestion: What is dependent upon electrical potential energy?\n\nAnswer:  Elastic energy in materials\n\nTitle: Paper\n\nBackground: Paper made from wood pulp is not necessarily less durable than a rag paper. The ageing behavior of a paper is determined by its manufacture, not the original source of the fibres. Furthermore, tests sponsored by the Library of Congress prove that all paper is at risk of acid decay, because cellulose itself produces formic, acetic, lactic and oxalic acids.\n\nQuestion: Who sponsored tests that proved all paper is risk free from acid decay?\n\nAnswer:  unanswerable\n\nTitle: Norfolk_Island\n\nBackground: As a relatively small and isolated oceanic island, Norfolk has few land birds but a high degree of endemicity among them.

Thunderstorms occur from May to September, that are occasionally severe with large hail, damaging winds and heavy downpours. Although downtown Boston has never been struck by a violent tornado, the city itself has experienced many tornado warnings.

Baron argues several reasons why this is the case, citing the unprecedented rise of the United States and its predominant position as the key reason. Baron highlights that since World War Two no other great power has been able to achieve parity or near parity with the United States, with the exception of the Soviet Union for a brief time. This position is unique among the great powers since the start of the modern era (the 16th century), where there has traditionally always been \"tremendous parity among the great powers\".

Since then, some brewers have used champagne yeasts to increase the alcohol content of their beers. Samuel Adams reached 20% abv with Millennium, and then surpassed that amount to 25.6% abv with Utopias. The strongest beer brewed in Britain was Baz's Super Brew by Parish Brewery, a 23% abv beer.

The key consumers of H\n2 in the petrochemical plant include hydrodealkylation, hydrodesulfurization, and hydrocracking. H\n2 has several other important uses. H\n2 is used as a hydrogenating agent, particularly in increasing the level of saturation of unsaturated fats and oils (found in items such as margarine), and in the production of methanol. It is similarly the source of hydrogen in the manufacture of hydrochloric acid.

They were compelled to obey all the rules and shared in all the applicable privileges of the order. Like the Priory of Dartford, all Dominican nunneries were under the jurisdiction of friars.

These processes offset energy that would otherwise come from a fossil fuel source and can also convert solar energy into storable and transportable fuels. Solar induced chemical reactions can be divided into thermochemical or photochemical. A variety of fuels can be produced by artificial photosynthesis. The multielectron catalytic chemistry involved in making carbon-based fuels (such as methanol) from reduction of carbon dioxide is challenging; a feasible alternative is hydrogen production from protons, though use of water as the source of electrons (as plants do) requires mastering the multielectron oxidation of two water molecules to molecular oxygen. Some have envisaged working solar fuel plants in coastal metropolitan areas by 2050 \u2013  the splitting of sea water providing hydrogen to be run through adjacent fuel-cell electric power plants and the pure water by-product going directly into the municipal water system. Another vision involves all human structures covering the earth's surface (i.e., roads, vehicles and buildings) doing photosynthesis more efficiently than plants.\n\nQuestion: What solar process can be used to produce different fuels?\n\nAnswer:  artificial photosynthesis\n\nTitle: Iran\n\nBackground: The centuries-long geopolitical and ideological rivalry between Safavid Iran and the neighboring Ottoman Empire, led to numerous Ottoman\u2013Persian Wars. The Safavid Era peaked in the reign of Abbas the Great, 1587\u20131629, surpassing their Ottoman arch rivals in strength, and making the empire a leading hub in Western Eurasia for the sciences and arts. The Safavid Era saw the start of mass integration from Caucasian populations into new layers of the society of Iran, as well as mass resettlement of them within the heartlands of Iran, playing a pivotal role in the history of Iran for centuries onwards. Following a gradual decline in the late 1600s and early 1700s, which was caused by the internal conflicts, the continuous wars with the Ottomans, and the foreign interference (most notably the Russian interference), the Safavid rule was ended by the Pashtun rebels who besieged Isfahan and defeated Soltan Hosein in 1722.\n\nQuestion: What Empire neighbored and had a rivalry with Safavid Iran?\n\nAnswer:  Ottoman Empire\n\nTitle: Black_people\n\nBackground: The concept of blackness in the United States has been described as the degree to which one associates themselves with mainstream African-American culture, politics, and values. To a certain extent, this concept is not so much about race but more about political orientation, culture and behavior. Blackness can be contrasted with \"acting white\", where black Americans are said to behave with assumed characteristics of stereotypical white Americans with regard to fashion, dialect, taste in music, and possibly, from the perspective of a significant number of black youth, academic achievement.\n\nQuestion: What defines \"blackness\"?\n\nAnswer:  political orientation, culture and behavior\n\nTitle: Normans\n\nBackground: The Normans were in contact with England from an early date.

The multielectron catalytic chemistry involved in making carbon-based fuels (such as methanol) from reduction of carbon dioxide is challenging; a feasible alternative is hydrogen production from protons, though use of water as the source of electrons (as plants do) requires mastering the multielectron oxidation of two water molecules to molecular oxygen. Some have envisaged working solar fuel plants in coastal metropolitan areas by 2050 \u2013  the splitting of sea water providing hydrogen to be run through adjacent fuel-cell electric power plants and the pure water by-product going directly into the municipal water system. Another vision involves all human structures covering the earth's surface (i.e., roads, vehicles and buildings) doing photosynthesis more efficiently than plants.\n\nQuestion: What solar process can be used to produce different fuels?\n\nAnswer:  artificial photosynthesis\n\nTitle: Iran\n\nBackground: The centuries-long geopolitical and ideological rivalry between Safavid Iran and the neighboring Ottoman Empire, led to numerous Ottoman\u2013Persian Wars. The Safavid Era peaked in the reign of Abbas the Great, 1587\u20131629, surpassing their Ottoman arch rivals in strength, and making the empire a leading hub in Western Eurasia for the sciences and arts. The Safavid Era saw the start of mass integration from Caucasian populations into new layers of the society of Iran, as well as mass resettlement of them within the heartlands of Iran, playing a pivotal role in the history of Iran for centuries onwards. Following a gradual decline in the late 1600s and early 1700s, which was caused by the internal conflicts, the continuous wars with the Ottomans, and the foreign interference (most notably the Russian interference), the Safavid rule was ended by the Pashtun rebels who besieged Isfahan and defeated Soltan Hosein in 1722.\n\nQuestion: What Empire neighbored and had a rivalry with Safavid Iran?\n\nAnswer:  Ottoman Empire\n\nTitle: Black_people\n\nBackground: The concept of blackness in the United States has been described as the degree to which one associates themselves with mainstream African-American culture, politics, and values. To a certain extent, this concept is not so much about race but more about political orientation, culture and behavior. Blackness can be contrasted with \"acting white\", where black Americans are said to behave with assumed characteristics of stereotypical white Americans with regard to fashion, dialect, taste in music, and possibly, from the perspective of a significant number of black youth, academic achievement.\n\nQuestion: What defines \"blackness\"?\n\nAnswer:  political orientation, culture and behavior\n\nTitle: Normans\n\nBackground: The Normans were in contact with England from an early date. Not only were their original Viking brethren still ravaging the English coasts, they occupied most of the important ports opposite England across the English Channel. This relationship eventually produced closer ties of blood through the marriage of Emma, sister of Duke Richard II of Normandy, and King Ethelred II of England. Because of this, Ethelred fled to Normandy in 1013, when he was forced from his kingdom by Sweyn Forkbeard. His stay in Normandy (until 1016) influenced him and his sons by Emma, who stayed in Normandy after Cnut the Great's conquest of the isle.\n\nQuestion: Who's major ports were controlled by the English?\n\nAnswer:", " unanswerable"]], "resps": [["  Normans"], [[-21.796875, false]]], "filtered_resps": ["  Normans", [-21.796875, false]], "filter": "none", "metrics": ["exact", "f1", "HasAns_exact", "HasAns_f1", "NoAns_exact", "NoAns_f1", "best_exact", "best_f1"], "doc_hash": "6f92e438fc54b3958adc853480bf0acd9a8c41a55f37b35aaa356db34cf2a8ce", "prompt_hash": "28566db09f0f3ab7cb651a327ccc2b8e9cb1612d0babb46e2a0fd5feb6499fbc", "target_hash": "a77a7434534bff301720676f050b879d5dcc80c28a20c845042f472eb1790710", "exact": [{"id": "5ad3f187604f3c001a3ff871", "prediction_text": "  Normans", "no_answer_probability": 3.4177277508975546e-10}, {"id": "5ad3f187604f3c001a3ff871", "answers": {"text": [], "answer_start": []}}], "f1": [{"id": "5ad3f187604f3c001a3ff871", "prediction_text": "  Normans", "no_answer_probability": 3.4177277508975546e-10}, {"id": "5ad3f187604f3c001a3ff871", "answers": {"text": [], "answer_start": []}}], "HasAns_exact": [{"id": "5ad3f187604f3c001a3ff871", "prediction_text": "  Normans", "no_answer_probability": 3.4177277508975546e-10}, {"id": "5ad3f187604f3c001a3ff871", "answers": {"text": [], "answer_start": []}}], "HasAns_f1": [{"id": "5ad3f187604f3c001a3ff871", "prediction_text": "  Normans", "no_answer_probability": 3.4177277508975546e-10}, {"id": "5ad3f187604f3c001a3ff871", "answers": {"text": [], "answer_start": []}}], "NoAns_exact": [{"id": "5ad3f187604f3c001a3ff871", "prediction_text": "  Normans", "no_answer_probability": 3.4177277508975546e-10}, {"id": "5ad3f187604f3c001a3ff871", "answers": {"text": [], "answer_start": []}}], "NoAns_f1": [{"id": "5ad3f187604f3c001a3ff871", "prediction_text": "  Normans", "no_answer_probability": 3.4177277508975546e-10}, {"id": "5ad3f187604f3c001a3ff871", "answers": {"text": [], "answer_start": []}}], "best_exact": [{"id": "5ad3f187604f3c001a3ff871", "prediction_text": "  Normans", "no_answer_probability": 3.4177277508975546e-10}, {"id": "5ad3f187604f3c001a3ff871", "answers": {"text": [], "answer_start": []}}], "best_f1": [{"id": "5ad3f187604f3c001a3ff871", "prediction_text": "  Normans", "no_answer_probability": 3.4177277508975546e-10}, {"id": "5ad3f187604f3c001a3ff871", "answers": {"text": [], "answer_start": []}}]}, {"doc_id": 89, "doc": {"id": "56de1645cffd8e1900b4b5d0", "title": "Normans", "context": "When finally Edward the Confessor returned from his father's refuge in 1041, at the invitation of his half-brother Harthacnut, he brought with him a Norman-educated mind.

The regulation of child labour began from the earliest days of the Industrial revolution. The first act to regulate child labour in Britain was passed in 1803. As early as 1802 and 1819 Factory Acts were passed to regulate the working hours of workhouse children in factories and cotton mills to 12 hours per day. These acts were largely ineffective and after radical agitation, by for example the \"Short Time Committees\" in 1831, a Royal Commission recommended in 1833 that children aged 11\u201318 should work a maximum of 12 hours per day, children aged 9\u201311 a maximum of eight hours, and children under the age of nine were no longer permitted to work. This act however only applied to the textile industry, and further agitation led to another act in 1847 limiting both adults and children to 10-hour working days.

Many political parties have an ideological core, but some do not, and many represent very different ideologies than they did when first founded. In democracies, political parties are elected by the electorate to run a government. Many countries have numerous powerful political parties, such as Germany and India and some nations have one-party systems, such as China.

It was really the caliphate of Uthman Ibn Affan (644\u2013656), a member of Umayyad clan himself, that witnessed the revival and then the ascendancy of the Umayyad clan to the corridors of power. Uthman placed some of the trusted members of his clan at prominent and strong positions throughout the state. Most notable was the appointment of Marwan ibn al-Hakam, Uthman's first cousin, as his top advisor, which created a stir among the Hashimite companions of Muhammad, as Marwan along with his father Al-Hakam ibn Abi al-'As had been permanently exiled from Medina by Muhammad during his lifetime. Uthman also appointed as governor of Kufa his half-brother, Walid ibn Uqba, who was accused by Hashmites of leading prayer while under the influence of alcohol. Uthman also consolidated Muawiyah's governorship of Syria by granting him control over a larger area and appointed his foster brother Abdullah ibn Saad as the Governor of Egypt.

As an adolescent's social sphere develops rapidly as they distinguish the differences between friends and acquaintances, they often become heavily emotionally invested in friends. This is not harmful; however, if these friends expose an individual to potentially harmful situations, this is an aspect of peer pressure. Adolescence is a critical period in social development because adolescents can be easily influenced by the people they develop close relationships with. This is the first time individuals can truly make their own decisions, which also makes this a sensitive period. Relationships are vital in the social development of an adolescent due to the extreme influence peers can have over an individual. These relationships become significant because they begin to help the adolescent understand the concept of personalities, how they form and why a person has that specific type of personality. \"The use of psychological comparisons could serve both as an index of the growth of an implicit personality theory and as a component process accounting for its creation. In other words, by comparing one person's personality characteristics to another's, we would be setting up the framework for creating a general theory of personality (and, ... such a theory would serve as a useful framework for coming to understand specific persons).\" This can be likened to the use of social comparison in developing one\u2019s identity and self-concept, which includes ones personality, and underscores the importance of communication, and thus relationships, in one\u2019s development. In social comparison we use reference groups, with respect to both psychological and identity development. These reference groups are the peers of adolescents. This means that who the teen chooses/accepts as their friends and who they communicate with on a frequent basis often makes up their reference groups and can therefore have a huge impact on who they become.

It typically continues through August and sometimes into September. During the monsoon, the humidity is much higher than the rest of the year. It begins with clouds building up from the south in the early afternoon followed by intense thunderstorms and rainfall, which can cause flash floods. The evening sky at this time of year is often pierced with dramatic lightning strikes. Large areas of the city do not have storm sewers, so monsoon rains flood the main thoroughfares, usually for no longer than a few hours. A few underpasses in Tucson have \"feet of water\" scales painted on their supports to discourage fording by automobiles during a rainstorm. Arizona traffic code Title 28-910, the so-called \"Stupid Motorist Law\", was instituted in 1995 to discourage people from entering flooded roadways. If the road is flooded and a barricade is in place, motorists who drive around the barricade can be charged up to $2000 for costs involved in rescuing them. Despite all warnings and precautions, however, three Tucson drivers have drowned between 2004 and 2010.\n\nQuestion: When was the \"Stupid Motorist Law\" passed?\n\nAnswer:  1995\n\nTitle: University\n\nBackground: By the end of the early modern period, the structure and orientation of higher education had changed in ways that are eminently recognizable for the modern context. Aristotle was no longer a force providing the epistemological and methodological focus for universities and a more mechanistic orientation was emerging. The hierarchical place of theological knowledge had for the most part been displaced and the humanities had become a fixture, and a new openness was beginning to take hold in the construction and dissemination of knowledge that were to become imperative for the formation of the modern state.\n\nQuestion: The change in universities towards the completion of the modern period is credited with the formation of what entity?\n\nAnswer:  unanswerable\n\nTitle: Mesozoic\n\nBackground: The Early Jurassic spans from 200 million years to 175 million years ago. The climate was much more humid than the Triassic, and as a result, the world was very tropical. In the oceans, Plesiosaurs, Ichthyosaurs and Ammonites fill waters as the dominant races of the seas. On land, dinosaurs and other reptiles stake their claim as the dominant race of the land, with species such as Dilophosaurus at the top. The first true crocodiles evolved, pushing out the large amphibians to near extinction. All-in-all, reptiles rise to rule the world. Meanwhile, the first true mammals evolve, but remained relatively small sized.\n\nQuestion: Reptiles were a submissive species during what time period?\n\nAnswer:  unanswerable\n\nTitle: Glass\n\nBackground: Although the atomic structure of glass shares characteristics of the structure in a supercooled liquid, glass tends to behave as a solid below its glass transition temperature. A supercooled liquid behaves as a liquid, but it is below the freezing point of the material, and in some cases will crystallize almost instantly if a crystal is added as a core. The change in heat capacity at a glass transition and a melting transition of comparable materials are typically of the same order of magnitude, indicating that the change in active degrees of freedom is comparable as well. Both in a glass and in a crystal it is mostly only the vibrational degrees of freedom that remain active, whereas rotational and translational motion is arrested. This helps to explain why both crystalline and non-crystalline solids exhibit rigidity on most experimental time scales.\n\nQuestion: In traditional motion, what types of movement stop?\n\nAnswer:  unanswerable\n\nTitle: Race_(human_categorization)\n\nBackground: Traditionally, subspecies are seen as geographically isolated and genetically differentiated populations. That is, \"the designation 'subspecies' is used to indicate an objective degree of microevolutionary divergence\" One objection to this idea is that it does not specify what degree of differentiation is required. Therefore, any population that is somewhat biologically different could be considered a subspecies, even to the level of a local population. As a result, Templeton has argued that it is necessary to impose a threshold on the level of difference that is required for a population to be designated a subspecies.\n\nQuestion: What are traditionally geographically isolated?\n\nAnswer:  subspecies\n\nTitle: Normans\n\nBackground: When finally Edward the Confessor returned from his father's refuge in 1041, at the invitation of his half-brother Harthacnut, he brought with him a Norman-educated mind. He also brought many Norman counsellors and fighters, some of whom established an English cavalry force. This concept never really took root, but it is a typical example of the attitudes of Edward. He appointed Robert of Jumi\u00e8ges archbishop of Canterbury and made Ralph the Timid earl of Hereford. He invited his brother-in-law Eustace II, Count of Boulogne to his court in 1051, an event which resulted in the greatest of early conflicts between Saxon and Norman and ultimately resulted in the exile of Earl Godwin of Wessex.\n\nQuestion: When did Edward return?\n\nAnswer:", {"until": ["\n"]}], ["Title: Multiracial_American\n\nBackground: Some biographical accounts include the autobiography Life on the Color Line: The True Story of a White Boy Who Discovered He Was Black by Gregory Howard Williams; One Drop: My Father's Hidden Life\u2014A Story of Race and Family Secrets written by Bliss Broyard about her father Anatole Broyard; the documentary Colored White Boy about a white man in North Carolina who discovers that he is the descendant of a white plantation owner and a raped African slave; and the documentary on The Sanders Women of Shreveport, Louisiana.\n\nQuestion: What documentary features a black man in North Carolina?\n\nAnswer:  unanswerable\n\nTitle: Tucson,_Arizona\n\nBackground: The monsoon can begin any time from mid-June to late July, with an average start date around July 3. It typically continues through August and sometimes into September. During the monsoon, the humidity is much higher than the rest of the year. It begins with clouds building up from the south in the early afternoon followed by intense thunderstorms and rainfall, which can cause flash floods. The evening sky at this time of year is often pierced with dramatic lightning strikes. Large areas of the city do not have storm sewers, so monsoon rains flood the main thoroughfares, usually for no longer than a few hours.

Without predation, herbivores began to over-graze many woody browse species, affecting the area's plant populations. In addition, wolves often kept animals from grazing in riparian areas, which protected beavers from having their food sources encroached upon. The removal of wolves had a direct effect on beaver populations, as their habitat became territory for grazing. Furthermore, predation keeps hydrological features such as creeks and streams in normal working order.

Consumption of pork was considered taboo until a few decades ago. Due to the intermixing with Kirat cuisine from eastern Nepal, pork has found a place in Kathmandu dishes. A fringe population of devout Hindus and Muslims consider it taboo. The Muslims forbid eating buff as from Quran while Hindus eat all varieties except Cow's meat as the consider Cow to be a goddess and symbol of purity.

Enantiornithes occupied a wide array of ecological niches, from sand-probing shorebirds and fish-eaters to tree-dwelling forms and seed-eaters. While they were the dominant group of avialans during the Cretaceous period, enantiornithes became extinct along with many other dinosaur groups at the end of the Mesozoic era.\n\nQuestion: What were the first large, diverse lineage of short-tailed avialans to evolve?\n\nAnswer:  enantiornithes\n\nTitle: Slavs\n\nBackground: The word slovo (\"word\") and the related slava (\"fame\") and slukh (\"hearing\") originate from the Proto-Indo-European root *\u1e31lew- (\"be spoken of, fame\"), cognate with Ancient Greek \u03ba\u03bb\u1fc6\u03c2 (kl\u00eas - \"famous\"), whence the name Pericles, and Latin clueo (\"be called\"), and English loud.\n\nQuestion: What does the Latin word \"klew\" mean?\n\nAnswer:  unanswerable\n\nTitle: Alfred_North_Whitehead\n\nBackground: Whitehead makes the startling observation that \"life is comparatively deficient in survival value.\" If humans can only exist for about a hundred years, and rocks for eight hundred million, then one is forced to ask why complex organisms ever evolved in the first place; as Whitehead humorously notes, \"they certainly did not appear because they were better at that game than the rocks around them.\" He then observes that the mark of higher forms of life is that they are actively engaged in modifying their environment, an activity which he theorizes is directed toward the three-fold goal of living, living well, and living better.

During this time, there was also research into other forms of digital video and audio communication. Many of these technologies, such as the Media space, are not as widely used today as videoconferencing but were still an important area of research. The first dedicated systems started to appear in the market as ISDN networks were expanding throughout the world. One of the first commercial videoconferencing systems sold to companies came from PictureTel Corp., which had an Initial Public Offering in November, 1984.\n\nQuestion: What is the minimum bit rate for compressed video and audio transmission?\n\nAnswer:  128 kilobits/s\n\nTitle: Pain\n\nBackground: The International Association for the Study of Pain advocates that the relief of pain should be recognized as a human right, that chronic pain should be considered a disease in its own right, and that pain medicine should have the full status of a specialty. It is a specialty only in China and Australia at this time. Elsewhere, pain medicine is a subspecialty under disciplines such as anesthesiology, physiatry, neurology, palliative medicine and psychiatry. In 2011, Human Rights Watch alerted that tens of millions of people worldwide are still denied access to inexpensive medications for severe pain.\n\nQuestion: What should chronic pain be considered in its own right?\n\nAnswer:  a disease\n\nTitle: British_Isles\n\nBackground: Many larger animals, such as wolf, bear and the European elk are today extinct. However, some species such as red deer are protected. Other small mammals, such as rabbits, foxes, badgers, hares, hedgehogs, and stoats, are very common and the European beaver has been reintroduced in parts of Scotland. Wild boar have also been reintroduced to parts of southern England, following escapes from boar farms and illegal releases. Many rivers contain otters and seals are common on coasts. Over 200 species of bird reside permanently and another 200 migrate. Common types are the common chaffinch, common blackbird, house sparrow and common starling; all small birds. Large birds are declining in number, except for those kept for game such as pheasant, partridge, and red grouse. Fish are abundant in the rivers and lakes, in particular salmon, trout, perch and pike. Sea fish include dogfish, cod, sole, pollock and bass, as well as mussels, crab and oysters along the coast. There are more than 21,000 species of insects.\n\nQuestion: What kinds of fish are abundent in the British Isles?\n\nAnswer:  salmon, trout, perch and pike\n\nTitle: Appalachian_Mountains\n\nBackground: While exploring inland along the northern coast of Florida in 1528, the members of the Narv\u00e1ez expedition, including \u00c1lvar N\u00fa\u00f1ez Cabeza de Vaca, found a Native American village near present-day Tallahassee, Florida whose name they transcribed as Apalchen or Apalachen [a.pa\u02c8la.t\u0283\u025bn]. The name was soon altered by the Spanish to Apalachee and used as a name for the tribe and region spreading well inland to the north. P\u00e1nfilo de Narv\u00e1ez's expedition first entered Apalachee territory on June 15, 1528, and applied the name.

There is also the Nuffield Theatre based at the University of Southampton's Highfield campus, which is the city's primary producing theatre. It was awarded The Stage Award for Best Regional Theatre in 2015.

Besides, there are many other department store groups, such as Pacific, Parkson, Wangfujing\uff0cNew World\uff0cetc., many of them are expanding quickly by listing in the financial market.\n\nQuestion: What began the influx of Japanese department stores?\n\nAnswer:  unanswerable\n\nTitle: Videoconferencing\n\nBackground: It was only in the 1980s that digital telephony transmission networks became possible, such as with ISDN networks, assuring a minimum bit rate (usually 128 kilobits/s) for compressed video and audio transmission. During this time, there was also research into other forms of digital video and audio communication. Many of these technologies, such as the Media space, are not as widely used today as videoconferencing but were still an important area of research. The first dedicated systems started to appear in the market as ISDN networks were expanding throughout the world. One of the first commercial videoconferencing systems sold to companies came from PictureTel Corp., which had an Initial Public Offering in November, 1984.\n\nQuestion: What is the minimum bit rate for compressed video and audio transmission?\n\nAnswer:  128 kilobits/s\n\nTitle: Pain\n\nBackground: The International Association for the Study of Pain advocates that the relief of pain should be recognized as a human right, that chronic pain should be considered a disease in its own right, and that pain medicine should have the full status of a specialty. It is a specialty only in China and Australia at this time. Elsewhere, pain medicine is a subspecialty under disciplines such as anesthesiology, physiatry, neurology, palliative medicine and psychiatry. In 2011, Human Rights Watch alerted that tens of millions of people worldwide are still denied access to inexpensive medications for severe pain.\n\nQuestion: What should chronic pain be considered in its own right?\n\nAnswer:  a disease\n\nTitle: British_Isles\n\nBackground: Many larger animals, such as wolf, bear and the European elk are today extinct. However, some species such as red deer are protected. Other small mammals, such as rabbits, foxes, badgers, hares, hedgehogs, and stoats, are very common and the European beaver has been reintroduced in parts of Scotland. Wild boar have also been reintroduced to parts of southern England, following escapes from boar farms and illegal releases. Many rivers contain otters and seals are common on coasts. Over 200 species of bird reside permanently and another 200 migrate. Common types are the common chaffinch, common blackbird, house sparrow and common starling; all small birds. Large birds are declining in number, except for those kept for game such as pheasant, partridge, and red grouse. Fish are abundant in the rivers and lakes, in particular salmon, trout, perch and pike. Sea fish include dogfish, cod, sole, pollock and bass, as well as mussels, crab and oysters along the coast. There are more than 21,000 species of insects.\n\nQuestion: What kinds of fish are abundent in the British Isles?\n\nAnswer:  salmon, trout, perch and pike\n\nTitle: Appalachian_Mountains\n\nBackground: While exploring inland along the northern coast of Florida in 1528, the members of the Narv\u00e1ez expedition, including \u00c1lvar N\u00fa\u00f1ez Cabeza de Vaca, found a Native American village near present-day Tallahassee, Florida whose name they transcribed as Apalchen or Apalachen [a.pa\u02c8la.t\u0283\u025bn]. The name was soon altered by the Spanish to Apalachee and used as a name for the tribe and region spreading well inland to the north. P\u00e1nfilo de Narv\u00e1ez's expedition first entered Apalachee territory on June 15, 1528, and applied the name. Now spelled \"Appalachian,\" it is the fourth-oldest surviving European place-name in the US.\n\nQuestion: How was the name of the Narvaez expedition transcribed?\n\nAnswer:  unanswerable\n\nTitle: Southampton\n\nBackground: The largest theatre in the city is the 2,300 capacity Mayflower Theatre (formerly known as the Gaumont), which, as the largest theatre in Southern England outside London, has hosted West End shows such as Les Mis\u00e9rables, The Rocky Horror Show and Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, as well as regular visits from Welsh National Opera and English National Ballet. There is also the Nuffield Theatre based at the University of Southampton's Highfield campus, which is the city's primary producing theatre. It was awarded The Stage Award for Best Regional Theatre in 2015. It also hosts touring companies and local performing societies (such as Southampton Operatic Society, the Maskers and the University Players).\n\nQuestion: What's the biggest theatre in Southampton?\n\nAnswer:  Mayflower Theatre\n\nTitle: Normans\n\nBackground: When finally Edward the Confessor returned from his father's refuge in 1041, at the invitation of his half-brother Harthacnut, he brought with him a Norman-educated mind. He also brought many Norman counsellors and fighters, some of whom established an English cavalry force. This concept never really took root, but it is a typical example of the attitudes of Edward. He appointed Robert of Jumi\u00e8ges archbishop of Canterbury and made Ralph the Timid earl of Hereford. He invited his brother-in-law Eustace II, Count of Boulogne to his court in 1051, an event which resulted in the greatest of early conflicts between Saxon and Norman and ultimately resulted in the exile of Earl Godwin of Wessex.\n\nQuestion: What kind of force did Harthacnut establish?\n\nAnswer:", " unanswerable"]], "resps": [["  Norman counsellors"], [[-6.234375, false]]], "filtered_resps": ["  Norman counsellors", [-6.234375, false]], "filter": "none", "metrics": ["exact", "f1", "HasAns_exact", "HasAns_f1", "NoAns_exact", "NoAns_f1", "best_exact", "best_f1"], "doc_hash": "ac6d584153288375f558191d6533adb4f2a2ead8a2ec1a7438d90dba49cfc7f1", "prompt_hash": "53351efc70805b78e31db0676755ae5a4d7a9b55b3ba473a012e81dbf70f5f7f", "target_hash": "a77a7434534bff301720676f050b879d5dcc80c28a20c845042f472eb1790710", "exact": [{"id": "5ad3f350604f3c001a3ff8f0", "prediction_text": "  Norman counsellors", "no_answer_probability": 0.0019608543654049855}, {"id": "5ad3f350604f3c001a3ff8f0", "answers": {"text": [], "answer_start": []}}], "f1": [{"id": "5ad3f350604f3c001a3ff8f0", "prediction_text": "  Norman counsellors", "no_answer_probability": 0.0019608543654049855}, {"id": "5ad3f350604f3c001a3ff8f0", "answers": {"text": [], "answer_start": []}}], "HasAns_exact": [{"id": "5ad3f350604f3c001a3ff8f0", "prediction_text": "  Norman counsellors", "no_answer_probability": 0.0019608543654049855}, {"id": "5ad3f350604f3c001a3ff8f0", "answers": {"text": [], "answer_start": []}}], "HasAns_f1": [{"id": "5ad3f350604f3c001a3ff8f0", "prediction_text": "  Norman counsellors", "no_answer_probability": 0.0019608543654049855}, {"id": "5ad3f350604f3c001a3ff8f0", "answers": {"text": [], "answer_start": []}}], "NoAns_exact": [{"id": "5ad3f350604f3c001a3ff8f0", "prediction_text": "  Norman counsellors", "no_answer_probability": 0.0019608543654049855}, {"id": "5ad3f350604f3c001a3ff8f0", "answers": {"text": [], "answer_start": []}}], "NoAns_f1": [{"id": "5ad3f350604f3c001a3ff8f0", "prediction_text": "  Norman counsellors", "no_answer_probability": 0.0019608543654049855}, {"id": "5ad3f350604f3c001a3ff8f0", "answers": {"text": [], "answer_start": []}}], "best_exact": [{"id": "5ad3f350604f3c001a3ff8f0", "prediction_text": "  Norman counsellors", "no_answer_probability": 0.0019608543654049855}, {"id": "5ad3f350604f3c001a3ff8f0", "answers": {"text": [], "answer_start": []}}], "best_f1": [{"id": "5ad3f350604f3c001a3ff8f0", "prediction_text": "  Norman counsellors", "no_answer_probability": 0.0019608543654049855}, {"id": "5ad3f350604f3c001a3ff8f0", "answers": {"text": [], "answer_start": []}}]}, {"doc_id": 94, "doc": {"id": "5ad3f350604f3c001a3ff8f1", "title": "Normans", "context": "When finally Edward the Confessor returned from his father's refuge in 1041, at the invitation of his half-brother Harthacnut, he brought with him a Norman-educated mind.

The rug mentioned in the Kaptavan inscriptions is composed of three arches, \"covered with vegatative ornaments\", and bears an artistic resemblance to the illuminated manuscripts produced in Artsakh.\n\nQuestion: What are otsagorgs?\n\nAnswer:  serpent-carpets\n\nTitle: Diarrhea\n\nBackground: About 1.7 to 5 billion cases of diarrhea occur per year. It is most common in developing countries, where young children get diarrhea on average three times a year. Total deaths from diarrhea are estimated at 1.26 million in 2013 \u2013 down from 2.58 million in 1990. In 2012, it is the second most common cause of deaths in children younger than five (0.76 million or 11%). Frequent episodes of diarrhea are also a common cause of malnutrition and the most common cause in those younger than five years of age. Other long term problems that can result include stunted growth and poor intellectual development.\n\nQuestion: HOw many cases of diarrhea are there a year?\n\nAnswer:  1.7 to 5 billion cases\n\nTitle: Textual_criticism\n\nBackground: Bowers confronted a similar problem in his edition of Maggie. Crane originally printed the novel privately in 1893. To secure commercial publication in 1896, Crane agreed to remove profanity, but he also made stylistic revisions. Bowers's approach was to preserve the stylistic and literary changes of 1896, but to revert to the 1893 readings where he believed that Crane was fulfilling the publisher's intention rather than his own. There were, however, intermediate cases that could reasonably have been attributed to either intention, and some of Bowers's choices came under fire \u2013 both as to his judgment, and as to the wisdom of conflating readings from the two different versions of Maggie.\n\nQuestion: When was the third version of Maggie published?\n\nAnswer:  unanswerable\n\nTitle: Compact_disc\n\nBackground: The pits and lands themselves do not directly represent the zeros and ones of binary data. Instead, non-return-to-zero, inverted encoding is used: a change from pit to land or land to pit indicates a one, while no change indicates a series of zeros. There must be at least two and no more than ten zeros between each one, which is defined by the length of the pit. This in turn is decoded by reversing the eight-to-fourteen modulation used in mastering the disc, and then reversing the cross-interleaved Reed\u2013Solomon coding, finally revealing the raw data stored on the disc. These encoding techniques (defined in the Red Book) were originally designed for CD Digital Audio, but they later became a standard for almost all CD formats (such as CD-ROM).\n\nQuestion: What type of modulation is implemented when a disc is mastered?\n\nAnswer:  eight-to-fourteen\n\nTitle: Greeks\n\nBackground: Homer refers to the \"Hellenes\" (/\u02c8h\u025bli\u02d0nz/) as a relatively small tribe settled in Thessalic Phthia, with its warriors under the command of Achilleus. The Parian Chronicle says that Phthia was the homeland of the Hellenes and that this name was given to those previously called Greeks (\u0393\u03c1\u03b1\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03af). In Greek mythology, Hellen, the patriarch of Hellenes, was son of Pyrrha and Deucalion, who ruled around Phthia, the only survivors after the great deluge. It seems that the myth was invented when the Greek tribes started to separate from each other in certain areas of Greece and it indicates their common origin. Aristotle names ancient Hellas as an area in Epirus between Dodona and the Achelous river, the location of the great deluge of Deucalion, a land occupied by the Selloi and the \"Greeks\" who later came to be known as \"Hellenes\". Selloi were the priests of Dodonian Zeus and the word probably means \"sacrificers\" (compare Gothic saljan, \"present, sacrifice\"). There is currently no satisfactory etymology of the name Hellenes. Some scholars assert that the name Selloi changed to Sellanes and then to Hellanes-Hellenes. However this etymology connects the name Hellenes with the Dorians who occupied Epirus and the relation with the name Greeks given by the Romans becomes uncertain. The name Hellenes seems to be older and it was probably used by the Greeks with the establishment of the Great Amphictyonic League. This was an ancient association of Greek tribes with twelve founders which was organized to protect the great temples of Apollo in Delphi (Phocis) and of Demeter near Thermopylae (Locris). According to the legend it was founded after the Trojan War by the eponymous Amphictyon, brother of Hellen.\n\nQuestion:  Who is this small group not named for?\n\nAnswer:  unanswerable\n\nTitle: Korean_War\n\nBackground: On the night of 10 August in Washington, American Colonels Dean Rusk and Charles H. Bonesteel III were tasked with dividing the Korean Peninsula into Soviet and U.S. occupation zones and proposed the 38th parallel. This was incorporated into America's General Order No. 1 which responded to the Japanese surrender on 15 August. Explaining the choice of the 38th parallel, Rusk observed, \"even though it was further north than could be realistically reached by U.S. forces, in the event of Soviet disagreement...we felt it important to include the capital of Korea in the area of responsibility of American troops\". He noted that he was \"faced with the scarcity of US forces immediately available, and time and space factors, which would make it difficult to reach very far north, before Soviet troops could enter the area\". As Rusk's comments indicate, the Americans doubted whether the Soviet government would agree to this. Stalin, however, maintained his wartime policy of co-operation, and on 16 August the Red Army halted at the 38th parallel for three weeks to await the arrival of U.S. forces in the south.\n\nQuestion: What two areas was Korea divided into?\n\nAnswer:  Soviet and U.S. occupation zones\n\nTitle: Normans\n\nBackground: When finally Edward the Confessor returned from his father's refuge in 1041, at the invitation of his half-brother Harthacnut, he brought with him a Norman-educated mind.

Harkness Stone sculpture built into the walls of the buildings portray contemporary college personalities such as a writer, an athlete, a tea-drinking socialite, and a student who has fallen asleep while reading. Similarly, the decorative friezes on the buildings depict contemporary scenes such as policemen chasing a robber and arresting a prostitute (on the wall of the Law School), or a student relaxing with a mug of beer and a cigarette. The architect, James Gamble Rogers, faux-aged these buildings by splashing the walls with acid, deliberately breaking their leaded glass windows and repairing them in the style of the Middle Ages, and creating niches for decorative statuary but leaving them empty to simulate loss or theft over the ages. In fact, the buildings merely simulate Middle Ages architecture, for though they appear to be constructed of solid stone blocks in the authentic manner, most actually have steel framing as was commonly used in 1930.

He also ordered the construction of schools, roads and other infrastructure.:75\u201376 Later, Capt. Jose de Quiroga arrived in 1680 and continued some of the development projects started by his predecessors. He also continued the search for the rebels who had assassinated Father San Vitores, resulting in campaigns against the rebels which were hiding out in some islands, eventually leading to the death of Matapang, Hurao and Aguarin.:77\u201378 Quiroga brought some natives from the northern islands to Guam, ordering the population to live in a few large villages.:78\u201379 These included Jinapsan, Umatac, Pago, Agat and Inarajan, where he built a number of churches.:79 By July 1695, Quiroga had completed the pacification process in Guam, Rota, Tinian and Aguigan.:85\n\nQuestion: Who assassinated Father San Vitores?\n\nAnswer:  unanswerable\n\nTitle: Dominican_Order\n\nBackground: The province of France has produced a large number of preachers.

It is located in USDA plant hardiness zone 11a. Because of its location, nestled on the vast and open Santa Monica Bay, morning fog is a common phenomenon in May, June and early July (caused by ocean temperature variations and currents). Like other inhabitants of the greater Los Angeles area, residents have a particular terminology for this phenomenon: the \"May Gray\" and the \"June Gloom\". Overcast skies are common during June mornings, but usually the strong sun burns the fog off by noon. In the late winter/early summer, daily fog is a phenomenon too. It happens suddenly and it may last some hours or past sunset time. Nonetheless, it will sometimes stay cloudy and cool all day during June, even as other parts of the Los Angeles area enjoy sunny skies and warmer temperatures. At times, the sun can be shining east of 20th Street, while the beach area is overcast. As a general rule, the beach temperature is from 5 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit (3 to 6 degrees Celsius) cooler than it is inland during summer days, and 5\u201310 degrees warmer during winter nights.\n\nQuestion: How many days each year is is the beach area overcast?\n\nAnswer:  unanswerable\n\nTitle: Normans\n\nBackground: In 1066, Duke William II of Normandy conquered England killing King Harold II at the Battle of Hastings.

The solution in 1954 was to open the Northland Center in nearby Southfield, just beyond the city limits. It was the largest suburban shopping center in the world, and quickly became the main shopping destination for northern and western Detroit, and for much of the suburbs. By 1961 the downtown skyscraper accounted for only half of Hudson's sales; it closed in 1986. The Northland Center Hudson's, rebranded Macy's in 2006 following acquisition by Federated Department Stores, was closed along with the remaining stores in the center in March 2015 due to the mall's high storefront vacancy, decaying infrastructure, and financial mismanagement.\n\nQuestion: In what year did the Hudson's skyscraper close? \n\nAnswer:  1986\n\nTitle: Serbo-Croatian\n\nBackground: Like most Slavic languages, there are mostly three genders for nouns: masculine, feminine, and neuter, a distinction which is still present even in the plural (unlike Russian and, in part, the \u010cakavian dialect).

At the same time we want to sell our old flat.\nDiana: I understand. Thank you for contacting me, I think I will be able to assist you. Are you looking for a flat to buy or to rent?\nTom: This is one of the things we've been discussing with my wife. What are the current trends? Which option do you suggest?\nDiana: It depends on what you value more, it may sound obvious, but if you value stability more than flexibility, I would suggest you invest in buying a flat.\nTom: We were looking for something bigger than what we own now, but we may not have a budget for something we may need in the future.\nDiana: In this case I would suggest maybe buying something smaller to rent and renting at the same time a small flat to save or buying something slightly below the budget, so you could save for later.\nTom: Thank you! This is a great advice!\nTom: I will talk to my wife, but for now, I think we could focus on buying something similar size.\nDiana: How many rooms are you looking for?\nTom: Two bedrooms at least, joined kitchen and living room is fine as well.\nDiana: Do you have any preferred neighbourhood?\nTom: Anywhere near the tube station within zone 3 is acceptable.\nDiana: Thank you. What's your current budget?\nTom: We were thinking about \u00a3400 000. Would it be possible?\nDiana: I think so. Would you accept a flat that needs to be renovated?\nTom: It depends on how much we can sell our flat for.\nDiana: How much are you aiming for?\nTom: At least \u00a3300 000, it's in a very good condition, good neighbourhood and it has been renovated only a year ago.\nDiana: Could you please send me some pictures?

But the prices are better than the labels I would put on them, especially when you get an impromptu auction going. Nigel always likes to outbid Helen. I asked Helen to pretend to be interested in more books than she really is just to keep Nigel getting his wallet out.\nTarquin: Hah hah! I imagine she was only too happy to oblige. \nQuentin: Naturally. Top sort, that Helen.\nTarquin: What was that book they were bidding so hard over last time?\nQuentin: Oh. That was that book on Stalin by Simon Sebag Montefiore. I think I have about three copies of that around the shop priced up at ten zlotys each.\nTarquin: And what did Nigel end up paying?\nQuentin: 52 zlotys in the end. I could barely keep the smile off my face.\nTarquin: But it's really only the fun and games I think. He must have known he was overpaying and just doing it for a lark, because of the social evening.\nQuentin: Yes, that's probably it. Which is why I like to be generous with the wine and cheese. Especially the wine, I might add.\nTarquin: Yes. That's from Peter's company right?\nQuentin: indeed. And I can take orders for crates of them at a special \"Quentin price\" only on the evening of the unboxing.

I'm sorry if it's an inconvenience.\nAurore: Hello... hmmm, well the initial plan was to start with the costumes and that will definitely take over an hour. Of course, there will be other dances and games, but that was ment to be the main event... Are you sure you don't want to take part?\nAurore: I'm sorry that I haven't sent you the descriptions of your characters, but I can quickly summarise what part each of you would play (even for Natalie)... What exactly do you not like in this activity?\nAurore: Okay, you know what - I've thought things through. I won't send you your character descriptions - I guess while that event is taking place, you'll have to be next door (there are board games & films, so you should be entertained). Then, when the costume activity has ended (which I would like to point out, doesn't depend on me but on the participants of said activity), you can rejoin us.\nJulia: Well, we don't exactly understand what the game is... Is it something similar to charades?\nAurore: No!! Absolutely not!!!

I'm sorry for all the trouble we've caused you and thank you for explaining everything.\nAurore: It's okay (nature of the job, I suppose). But are you sure?

Many thanks you the NY greetings. What was 2018 like for you then? \nHelen: It has not been a good year for injuries, I'm afraid.\nHelen: My bad back (bulging disc) I have had for 30 years now, and I manage it pretty well most of the time. As long as I keep fairly fit (especially my \u201ccore\u201d muscles), it is not a big problem, as long as I don\u2019t stand or walk slowly! I can run, walk fast, cycle, kayak, swim anything really, and all of these activities are good for me, but standing still is a real trial.\nMicky: How can you manage everyday life without standing?!\nHelen: Most of the time I can avoid standing, and have no problems at all, but it makes visiting art galleries and museums, and parties, a lot more difficult.\nMicky: One can give museums a miss, but not parties. How about carrying one of these portable folding chairs with you?\nHelen: Got one! But I feel silly with it.\nHelen: This year I pushed to get a proper diagnosis of a hip which has been giving me problems on and off for 3 years. It proves to be in need of replacement..\nMicky: You mentioned that at Robert's do. When do you intend to have it done?\nHelen: Not sure but I did a lot of phoning round of friends in the medical profession (doctors, surgeons, physios, nurses etc \u2013 14 of them). With one exception they all said to leave it as long as possible. I also spoke to about 11 friends who had had the operation. Every one of them said it was the best thing they had ever done, and to book it in as soon as possible! So that was really helpful!\nMicky: Don't you have one surgeon with an overview of your bones' condition?

It may be easier that way :)\nJames: Of course, thanks!\nJames: <file_other>\nJenny: Hm, ok. First of all, I'd change the format and the layout. I think it's better to send your CV in pdf rather than doc.\nJames: Ok\nJenny: As for the layout, you have some cool experience and I think the way its presented doesn't give you justice. Netflix is an entertainment company so maybe make it more entertaining? ;) You can use different colours, graphs, make it more visual, not only informative.\nJames: Cool, never thought about it!\nJenny: It seems like you are a down-to-earth guy which is probably good for a project manager, but at Netflix we highly value the creative side of people :)\nJames: Thank you so much Jenny!

I think if you have an open mind, like to learn and work under pressure, you may like it. Fingers crossed!\nJames: Thanks!

More wars = more profit\nMartha: I just think the conflict wouldn't make sense from an economic standpoint.

But they have quite a large influence on Us policies\nMartha: That doesn't really matter either. It's not the government who will decide but corporate lobbyists. \nPeter: Yes but if they feel like they want to retain control they will just need an excuse to start something\nMartha: Not without business support.

People can't imagine life without it\nKelly: Yes, but we love this dream of life that is love and love that is life\nAnn: And this creates dependency, jealousy, frustrations, drama\nAnn: It's not even a very beautiful dream to be with someone all your life. The promise of no change. Stability forever. It is what capitalism needs from us - 40 years of mortgage and marriage\nKelly: Ahaha, yes and that somebody will take care of us when we are sick. \nAnn: Love is beautiful, intense, crazy and brief. And it was transformed in a long lasting good, a house. Something like this.\nKelly: But i think, or I suppose that we should be able to love for life potentially. We cannot approach love with a plan\nAnn: Yes, sure, but a substantial group of people, not one. But the problem is that love is mostly approached with one plan.

I\u2019m not sure which nation has developed the more stupid way to object to our government!\nGloria: But will you in your printing business be affected?\nTony: Dunno yet. Actually I've had very few commissions from abroad, so not directly. But we are all going to have less money in our pockets. So there'll be less interest in fancy printed matter.\nTony: But that will affect my holiday plans! And I hate that! The whole nonsense of exchanging money leaves me sick.

Any family or friends there?\nGloria: Do you think the second referendum is an option?\nTony: Definitely.

Still she can give me a few good tips. Do you remember if internet is really such a disaster there?\nHarry: Oh yes, it is.

We've been thinking about a skiing holiday though at Xmas.\nTessy: Smashing! Where to?\nHarry: Actually that's an adventurous part - to Israel. They seem to have some incredible slopes with topnotch infrastructure. A bloke from Notts Club was there last year and couldn't praise it too much.\nTessy: Funny enough I remember seeing their skiing brochures when we were there back in 2000. Sooo long time ago. By now it can be only better. Wouldn't it bit more on a pricey side?\nHarry: We'll manage 2 weeks. And it can't be more expensive that Austria.Not to mention Switzerland.

Yes, I've booked all my accommodation. Airbnb, I like to support the locals :)\nHarry: Very noble of you. But it's a bit of a tossup: you can get a superb flat or land in a rubbish hip.

I was 100% certain, you're going to sacrifice Chloe.\nHaley: I mean it wasn't an easy decision, but it made sense to me. What did you choose? \nNick: I sacrificed Chloe, obviously.\nHaley: obviously :P\nHaley: You know it's almost 50/50 with this choice among the players\nNick: I've seen the statistics, yes. So why did you choose Chloe?\nHaley: Because it's actually the one person that you truly care about. Who's like your best friend and means something to you. You've tried so hard for her and now you're just gonna throw that all away and kill her? I just couldn't do it.\nNick: Yes, but that's one life against several thousands of lives including Chloe's mother. How do you think that would make her feel?\nHaley: I know and as I said it was a devastating choice, but I couldn't let her die after all that emotional build-up.\nNick: I sorta get it... in theory. But for me the math was simple. Plus there was this part where you had to see the damage the storm had done and save your classmates and all that. It really got to me.\nHaley: I know all that but it was just... pursuit of happiness I guess. Like if it was Josie or your mom, what would you do?\nNick: yeah, but for me it wasn't a Josie/mom kind of relationship. Chloe and Max just spent several days together after some long years of zero contact. I just didn't really feel that close to Chloe, I guess.\nHaley: I totally adored her and actually felt guilty a lot o f times on Max's behalf for abandoning her like that those years ago. I know Chloe is difficult and troublesome, but for me that was kinda lovable.\nNick: I didn't connect with her like that at all. I mean it wasn't ok, what Max did, but I feel like Chloe was constantly guilt tripping Max throughout the game. It was kinda annoying.\nHaley: i dindn't really see it that way. Chloe's just sorta emotional, says what she feels.\nNick: That's a polite way to put it but ok. :P What about the other choices? And most importantly - did you water the plant? :D\nHaley: Yes! :D I watered it exactly right.\nNick: Haha, me too.

May only good spirits be with you and guide you through this world.\nHettie: Dear Peggie, how sweet of you to remember! Thank you very much.\nPeggie: I thought I'd contact you today rather than on your birthday proper so that I don't interrupt any celebrations. Time difference and so on.How are you doing?\nHettie: Certainly you wouldn't interrupt anything. The only celebration planned for tomorrow is an evening meal with my son and his wife. And with Thomas of course.\nHettie: Thank you. We are fine. Just the usual routine, nothing special happening. And how are you? Must be ages since we were in touch last!\nPeggie: Nothing of importance happens in a life of an old woman! Apart from occasional ailments and similar discomforts. Thank goodness I'm fine.\nPeggie: Laura, my daughter, gave birth to twins in March, two lovely girls, and my son Simon has moved house to Derry. A bit too far for me to drive to see them but I understand it's been necessary for his career. They say I should also move closer to them but I'm not ready to sell my house yet. As long as I feel fit to look after it, I'll stay here. So that's my news.\nPeggie: Would you remember old Mr Lars, my next door neighbour? Well, he passed away two months ago. A stroke, I heard. Such a nice person! And not that old at all. 86 or something.\nHettie: Congratulations and best wishes to Laura! So how many children have they got now? I've somehow lost count.\nHettie: Yes, I remember him. So sorry to hear about his death.\nPeggie: With the twins four. It's Simon whose family keeps on growing. They have got five children and Adela, Simon's wife, says she'd like to have a baby again. Well... They can surely afford it so why not? They are a very harmonious family.\nHettie: I can understand that you don't want to leave the house you've spent most of your life in. It's such a beautiful house too.\nHettie: By the way, we will probably be moving house soon too. A real estate agent, in fact a good friend of ours, has found an old farmhouse in need of a major overhaul in the area close to the Grampians. I have always wanted to live there! What's more, Thomas will be able to continue his research work in the National Park. We are both quite thrilled and hope it will happen.\nPeggie: Why shouldn't it, if I may ask?\nHettie: Sorry to be so confused about all these kids!\nHettie: It's a question of funds, very banal.\nPeggie: I'm sure you can sort it out. Anyway I'll keep my fingers crossed for you.\nHettie: Thanks Peggie. And thank you for the birthday wishes! Always nice to chat with you - across the ocean.\nPeggie: My pleasure. Aren't these electronic and digital gadgets wonderful? I'm so proud I've mastered the basic use of my smartphone.

I fell in the bathroom and badly hit my side. Can hardly move now.\nAndy: Good gracious! How did you manage that?\nBrenda: The floor was wet after I had a shower and I wanted to shake the rug, moved too fast, slipped, and hit with a thump my left side below the breast against the edge of the bathtub. Took my breath away for a sec. I even yelled or groaned or gasped. Anyway I was on the floor, shocked. Absolutely shocked. I thought, so that's how it happens. But I managed to get up and didn't realise the pain until I stretched to put my nighty on. Oh bro... Horrible....\nAndy: You could have killed yourself. Where are you now?\nBrenda: In bed. But I can hardly move. It's very painful all over the body. SHIIIIT!\nAndy: Maybe you should call in an ambulance? Are you sure you haven't broken something? A rib?\nBrenda: No, then I'd be howling with pain. It's just the impact of the fall that has, I don't know, damaged the tissue. Whatever I have here. Fat I suppose. It has to heal by itself.\nAndy: Can you breath normally?\nBrenda: Yes. I can't take a deep breath though.\nAndy: Can you touch your bruised side? Is it swollen? Red?\nBrenda: I can touch it, not press of course, but stroke. No, it isn't swollen. The skin is as usual, no discolouration. But this will come later, I suppose.\nAndy: Not necessarily. It might as well remain unaffected. I mean the epidermis, the skin itself. Though I'd expect it to develop a bruise.\nAndy: Are you coughing? Coughing blood?\nBrenda: God! No! I'll see how I feel in the morning. I just need a rest. I feel so rotten, bro...\nAndy: My worry would be that you've damaged something inside you. You know, split spleen, punctured lung.That sort of thing.You just watch your body.\nBrenda: Yes, I will. I understand what you mean. I thought so as well. Just see how I feel tomorrow morning. Fucking hell! I can hardly pull myself up.\nAndy: If I were you, I would go and see the doc first thing in the morning.\nBrenda: And he'll send me to have an x-ray. I can't bear the thought of driving or even walking.\nAndy: Well, he can come to your place and you'll be driven to hospital in an ambulance.\nBrenda: You stop scaring the shit out of me! I am not that invalid. It's just bloody painful but I think I'm in one piece.\nAndy: I don't know Brenda. One shouldn't take it too light those falls. You may still be in a state of shock and are underrating your condition. Will you phone me first thing in the morning please? Still from bed? Luise is gone by 7:30, so you won't be waking anyone up.\nBrenda: OK brother. I will give you a call. Of course if I'm still alive.\nAndy: Sister!! Anyway I wish you a good night's sleep.

Keep it up!\nLeon: How is your stay in Trinidad? Have you found good accommodation?\nDanny: Much to our shame I have to admit that we decided to stay in Las Cuevas, a state-run hotel. And that for a simple reason that airbnb doesn't list anything sensible and we didn't want to risk walking around the town dragging our suitcases and ask around for a room to rent. This hotel is just an easy option for us. It is quite OK, a bit too expensive, but in fact quite comfortable.\nLeon: I know the place. They have been in operation for nearly 60 years!\nDanny: Yes, we know. It was built as a motel for American tourist touring Cuba by car. But the politics had a different plan for them. Yet they seem to be doing fine with package tours.\nLeon: And organizing conferences and similar things. They are quite famous for it. I hope their food is alright for you.\nDanny: It's only breakfast as we prefer to eat in town. Every day a new place! Trinidad is absolutely fantastic for food with its choice of nearly a 100 restaurants. Pity so many of them are definitely too expensive for us. They are so beautiful!\nLeon: Sorry to hear that. But a fancy interior doesn't mean necessarily good food, does it?\nDanny: Not at all. We are absolutely happy with the place we've visited so far. The food was always excellent and the decor interesting. Very atmospheric places!\nLeon: Glad to hear it.

I'm hoping to actually work on it tonight, but I have to beta another story. Thanks again!!!\nMollie: Please do! I love all your stories but this one cuts the cake. :) I'm glad to hear you're feeling better :D and have fun Beta-ing! :P\nMollie: P.S. Can I ask dor a small-ish favour? Could you make Clara say (in that last chapter): \"run you clever boy\" or something like that? If not I get it :P\nAsh: I'm not sure if I can in the last chapter, BUT I was thinking about it...I might be able to make another itty bitty cameo with he...and I might be able to have her say it... I gotta think about how to incorporate it! \nMollie: There is an option to edit chapters - it's really weird but manageable. Wither way, having Clara back would be exciting :D\nAsh: Yeah... I know how to do that. I just wasn't sure if it made sense for her to say \"clever boy.\" But I'm gonna try to have her pop back in. Maybe in the last chapter. Want to make such a lovely reviewer happy :)\nAsh: Maybe this will make up for it until we get there? \nAsh: <file_other>\nMollie: Hey!! I'm so sorry I didn't reply earlier - I had a couple of trips going on and literally no time to check the Internet!!! :( Now my Inbox is stuffed with emails that need replying -_-\nMollie: Anyhoo, can I say how honoured I am that I got to see a sneak peek of the chapter (do you do this to all of your reviewers?? ;) ) and how much it made me want to read more! The chapter's lovely; I can't wait to see everyone;s reactions to Ian's presence in New York. :D\nMollie: One technical issue though - how on earth are you going to explain Ian's incredible late workload? Sorry, i'm just being picky... :P\nAsh: I'm glad you like the preview! No I only give certain people previews. If their comments have really touched me then I usually try to show my thanks by sending a preview. Chapter 27 picks up a couple months after Ian and Roses reconciliation. Ian did work in certain parts, like all day in Little Talks and several others. But you are right that he is behind, and I will make a comment to address that! Gotta keep ya all happy!!! ;) \nMollie: Out of curiosity though, are you ever going to have Ian tell Rose about switching realities experience??\nMollie: You could always have that as additional chapter, or you could have a chapter showing everyone's reactions to Ian and Rose being toegther (that would always be worth reading! :P) Either way, you have fun writing :D\nAsh: It's not my plan to have him reveal it. It was about the realization for Ian. About him seeing the truth that's always been there. I never felt that he needed to tell her about it. He just needed her.\nMollie: Awww, that last line *Swoon*\nMollie: But sure, it is your story :) You can do whatever you want :P\nMollie: What I keep wondering is what will happen to Ian once he reached 2025 in his own timeline, how will he react ect. Sorry for bugging you like this, it's all very interesting :P \nAsh: I hope I didn't come across rude!!! I wasn't at all trying to do that!!! I've had that question before. It's all a bit timey wimey and weird. It's not like Quantum Leap where one replaces the original and the \"original\" is somewhere.\nAsh: It's more of he was given this gift of jumping forward, so see what his life is/what it could be. But he had to make the decision if he was going to follow through. Was he going to make it happen, or was he going to give up the one thing in his life that made it precious? Was he going to fight for Rose? Was he going to believe that she loved him and allow himself that love? Paradox-y yes. Does that help? \nMollie: No, you didn't come off as rude - if anything, it made me think to myself: well done, you've just offended the author\" :P\nMollie: As for your explanation... er yeah kinda? I get why you did it for the plot (which also makes the plot more interesting), I'm just imaging Ian's reactions when he finally reaches 2025 and and thinks about how he woul have jumped timelines every day... am I making sense?

Anyway\nFrannie: I'm listening (or rather reading)\nJim: A substratum or substrate is essentially a language that existed in a given territory before another language\nFrannie: Ok\nJim: Then people speaking a different language arrived in that territory and slowly their language became the dominant one\nFrannie: And then the older language influences the new one, right?\nJim: Yes. The substratum slowly disappears but leaves some traces in the new language (the superstratum) like some words, pronunciation aspects and so on\nFrannie: Ok, so for example the Etruscan language was the substratum and Latin the superstratum, right?\nJim: Yes, and Etruscan influenced the local variety of latin in later centuries\nFrannie: Ok\nJim: I have a question too\nFrannie: You? I thought you were Mr. Perfect Notes\nJim: I am, but I missed two lessons in November\nFrannie: Ok\nJim: So... what was exactly the story with the name \"Mediolanum\"?\nFrannie: Ok, I know this one. In the ancient Celtic languages the Indoeuropean consonant \"p\" wasn't pronounced, for example the word for \"father\" was \"athir\" (vs. \"pater\" in Latin for example). So according to many scholars \"Mediolanum\" came from \"medio-\" and \"planum\" because there is no \"p\", so it's basically \"in the middle of the plane\".\nJim: Ok!

Because how are we dividing this project?\nSamantha: I think I'd like to talk about the history of the concept - like what was before Darwin and then about his idea in the \"origin of species\" \nTim: I've actually just finished reading the selfish gene by Dawkins and I would like to incorporate some of the stuff from the book. \nSamantha: Oh cool, was it good?\nTim: Great even.

You know that he coined the term meme?\nSamantha: oh cool, i had no idea. \nTim: so it would be great to talk about he's ideas in the presentation \nTim: *his\nSamantha: sure, you can talk about the modern understanding of natural selection and include Dawkins there \nTim: So I would give like the modern definition of it\nSamantha: Yeah, seems like it. If you want. \nTim: sure, can do that. What else do we need? \nSamantha: So we have - the history, the actual modern definition... maybe the evidence? We could mention like... you know, all the things they've dug up ;) \nTim: yes, the fossils and all that. \nTim: That's a good idea. And then maybe why it's important? Like how it changed science?\nSamantha: oh, that would be good - why it matters when it comes to our understanding of humanity's development, origin etc. \nSamantha: So you wanna take that part?\nTim: Yeah, could be interesting. \nSamantha: So I'll take the evidence part. \nTim: Great. It seems evenly divided. \nSamantha: Think so too.

My dad was afraid his instincts might come back again and he might start driving on the left side of the road, so we didn't but a car.
